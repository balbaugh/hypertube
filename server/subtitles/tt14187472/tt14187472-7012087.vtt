1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.923
How do you say "I love you"?

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.650
Again.

3
00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:10.899
Again.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.718
- First Nation's children and families
failed by a Child Welfare System in crisis.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.348
- Just how many Indigenous
children are currently

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.158
in the welfare system
across this country?

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.296
- These Federal programs are
so underfunded that Indigenous

8
00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.058
parents actually have to
give their children away.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.248
There's something
fundamentally wrong.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.098
First Nation's youth are five
to seven times more likely

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.438
to commit suicide than
non-Indigenous youth.

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.978
- This is where reconciliation
requires collaboration,

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.633
consultation with not
just the provinces and

14
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.288
territories, but with
First Nation leadership.

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.608
- Indigenous children are
vastly disproportionately

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.728
overrepresented in the
Child Welfare System.

17
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.728
Why hasn't something
been done sooner?

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.708
How did it get to this point?

19
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.858
- They have to ask themselves the
question, is there something else

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.912
that could be done other
than apprehending this child?

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.338
There are 48,000 children

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.847
in the Canadian child welfare
system today. Indigenous children

23
00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.863
comprise 29,000, making up 52% of
all Canada's children under care,

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.418
a shocking statistic given
that Indigenous children

25
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.948
make up only 7.7% of
the total population.

26
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.957
The numbers speak for themselves,
especially in western provinces

27
00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.903
and northern territories with
the rates going well above 90%.

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.473
It is a humanitarian crisis.

29
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.258
- Good morning Tribunal members.

30
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.778
What a great honor to stand on the
lands of the Algonquin Nation and

31
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.700
to have the very sacred conversation
blessed by the Elder this morning.

32
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.983
This very country is named
Canada, and it means village.

33
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.238
But for far too long,
there's been two villages

34
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.860
in this great nation,
one for all other

35
00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:29.148
children, and one for the
First Nation's children

36
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.406
who have called this land
home for thousands of years.

37
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.808
Children are the
keepers of the possible

38
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.283
and they are also experts
in love and fairness.

39
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.138
And they are the ones
who will often call us up

40
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.730
to be better people than
who we thought we could be

41
00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.305
and a better country
than we think we are.

42
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.998
- Home shapes us, it's a place
where our grandparents were,

43
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.681
it's a place where stories and
our languages, and our cultures

44
00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:36.063
were set for millennia,
because too many First Nation's

45
00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:39.448
children have grown up not
knowing the great traditions of

46
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.128
their people, not knowing their
languages and their cultures.

47
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.391
For our too many First Nations
children, their clearest

48
00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:49.653
memory of childhood is a day
that they were taken away.

49
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.510
This case, this moment
is for the children.

50
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.223
- Identity is one of the key factors
in healing, because identity grounds

51
00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:25.848
who you are, understanding where your
roots are, and where your culture is.

52
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.428
But because of some of the simulated
practices that were put in place by Canada,

53
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.628
the specific intent was to
break some of those cultural

54
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.468
or identity issues, where
a huge effort was made

55
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.168
to ban our traditional cultures,
practices, and ban the language.

56
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.888
So a lot of our people
were lost for generations.

57
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.650
- One of the really
bedrocks of colonialism

58
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.334
is what Robert Williams,
the Native American

59
00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:00.200
scholar, calls the Savage
Civilized Dichotomy,

60
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.048
- Indigenous peoples are
kind of cast over here

61
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.071
as the savages and the European kind
of culture is cast as the civilized.

62
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.408
- We were not taught anything
about the Indigenous people.

63
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.068
There was no talk about the culture, the
traditions, the richness of the culture,

64
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.497
nor did we talk about some of the
terrible things that we did as a people.

65
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:53.038
One of the biggest
threats to Indigenous

66
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.308
cultures that is still
felt today is the creation

67
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.414
of the Indian Act that
granted the Government of

68
00:06:58.456 --> 00:07:01.848
Canada sweeping powers over
First Nations identity,

69
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.443
political structures, governance,
cultural practices and education.

70
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.607
In 1920, Duncan Cambell
Scott, head of Indigenous

71
00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.738
Affairs made clear what
his intentions were.

72
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.448
I want to get rid of
the Indian problem.

73
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.542
I do not think, as a matter of
fact, that the country ought to

74
00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:23.988
continuously protect a class of
people who are able to stand alone.

75
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.738
Our objective is to continue until
there is not a single Indian in Canada

76
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.667
that has not been absorbed
into the body politic,

77
00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:33.596
and there is no Indian
in question and no Indian

78
00:07:33.638 --> 00:07:36.723
Department, that is the
whole object of this bill.

79
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.531
Subsequent amendments
led to First

80
00:07:41.573 --> 00:07:44.568
Nations children having to
attend Residential Schools.

81
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.788
The Residential School
system was implemented

82
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.628
by the Federal Government and
administered by various churches.

83
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.828
Over 130 Residential Schools operated
in Canada between 1831 and 1996.

84
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.118
It is estimated that 150,000
children attended these schools.

85
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.144
Innocent Aboriginal
children were extracted

86
00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:10.608
from their homes, separated from their
parents, siblings and communities.

87
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.186
Once at the schools, their hair
was cut; they were stripped

88
00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:17.763
of their traditional clothing,
and forced to wear uniforms.

89
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.698
In many cases, they were assigned
new Government-approved names.

90
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.959
Christian missionary staff criticized,
and denigrated Indigenous spiritual

91
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:31.220
traditions, even forbidding children
from speaking in their native language.

92
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.898
The schools were poorly
built and badly ventilated,

93
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.528
causing severe tuberculosis
and influenza outbreaks.

94
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.348
Smallpox, measles, typhoid, pneumonia
and whooping cough were prevalent.

95
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.127
Many Indigenous children
died as a result,

96
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:51.168
and some were laid to
rest in unmarked graves.

97
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.576
No loving embrace from
their parents, whom for

98
00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:55.983
a majority had no
knowledge of their passing.

99
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.908
Countless children were physically,
emotionally and sexually abused.

100
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.378
With no hope of seeing their families,
some students attempted to escape,

101
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.973
even going so far as
burning down the schools.

102
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.293
The horrors continued
for 99 years.

103
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.865
It is clear that the
Federal Government, and the

104
00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:20.972
Churches' intent was to
eradicate Aboriginal culture

105
00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:23.875
in Indigenous young people
and arrest the passing

106
00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:26.778
of the culture from one
generation to the next.

107
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.926
The Residential School system is commonly
considered a form of cultural genocide.

108
00:09:54.157 --> 00:09:59.157
- Alcoholism got the best of
me and I was getting worse.

109
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.878
I start shooting up and
covering up the pain

110
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.813
of First Nation school, strap, physical
abuse, sexual abuse, everything about that.

111
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.353
Survival, I call it survival.

112
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.568
50, I believe, I went
to Residential School,

113
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.610
black fancy car, priests
and Government workers.

114
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.863
And they tell my grandfather,
if he doesn't go to school,

115
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.838
we're going to put you
in jail and we are going

116
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.978
to take that $7 a month family
allowance away from you.

117
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.775
Father tell me to
stand up, I stood up.

118
00:10:36.817 --> 00:10:38.425
"Do you speak your
native tongue?"

119
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:40.158
"Yes, I do."

120
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.991
I was happy.

121
00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:42.318
"Roll your sleeves back."

122
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.951
So I rolled my sleeves back.

123
00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:51.858
The first time I ever got
strapped in my life from the sting

124
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.900
and burn, got to the point
where I was having seven

125
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.666
on each hand, strap burn, but I never
lost it, I still kept it with me.

126
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.353
My children were in, and I
couldn't get to see them,

127
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.298
because Social Service was giving us
a hard time because of my alcoholism.

128
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.188
So I respect that.

129
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.018
I'm glad they did that.

130
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.123
They never see me
messed up then.

131
00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:41.310
You know, I was in Duncan,
I happen to bring, I

132
00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:43.863
bought a bunch of booze,
because I was working.

133
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.498
So I went out, I've got a rope, put in a
garage in top, a block, here on my neck.

134
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.628
I was ready to
kick the block off.

135
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.354
A lady opened the door,

136
00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:02.576
"Roy, what are you going to do
with all the booze you bought?"

137
00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:03.618
"Oh, yes."

138
00:12:04.673 --> 00:12:11.280
I was taking out the rope,
and that's when I really, some

139
00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:17.928
people don't want to do it,
but it happened so quickly.

140
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.548
I couldn't take it
out, I just leave that.

141
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.900
I was lucky I didn't kick
that block off to take my...

142
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.388
Grandfather's trail.

143
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.407
He made this rock.

144
00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:42.498
Our grandfather's trail.

145
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.043
He made this water.

146
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.148
Our Grandfather's trail.

147
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.453
He made Mother Earth.

148
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.030
Okay.

149
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.958
- Today we recognize that this
policy of assimilation was wrong,

150
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.848
has caused great harm and
has no place in our country.

151
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.167
The Government of Canada
sincerely apologizes

152
00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:07.668
and ask the forgiveness
of the Aboriginal peoples

153
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.123
of this country for
failing them so profoundly.

154
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.628
The majority of
Elders born before

155
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.368
1965 have all gone to
Residential Schools.

156
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.873
The pain they endured
is widespread.

157
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.948
- It's a sad part of
history that happened

158
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.990
and children that were in
Residential School for six years,

159
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.018
seven years, eight years
never got to see their parents

160
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.868
or their parents were turned away
when they came to the school.

161
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.538
So, you know, a lot of
children didn't return home.

162
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.063
That's devastating for families
and for children growing up.

163
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.153
The devastation was harrowing.

164
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:50.568
As Residential Schools began to close,
the Federal Government invited provincial

165
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.798
Child Welfare Systems on
reserve to take their place.

166
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.708
In 1959 less than 1% of children
in foster care were Indigenous.

167
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.718
Within 10 years, that
number skyrocketed to 40%.

168
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.428
The term '60s Scoop was born, referring to
the practice of taking, or "scooping up,".

169
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.983
Indigenous children from their
families and communities.

170
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.688
Between the 1960s and the 1980s, over
20,000 Indigenous children were removed

171
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.498
from their homes, primarily
due to socioeconomic conditions

172
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.356
and placed for adoption in
Canada, the United States,

173
00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:32.253
and the United Kingdom, often
without parental consent.

174
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.618
- This is a special
adoption program.

175
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.626
For the past five years, the
number of children in care of the

176
00:14:40.668 --> 00:14:45.288
Department of Welfare has been
increasing by approximately 180 a year.

177
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.098
While we have had reasonable success
in placing white children for adoption,

178
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.928
we have had great difficulty in
placing Indian, and Métis children.

179
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.975
It is a well known fact that this can
never take the place of an adoption home

180
00:14:58.017 --> 00:15:00.798
where the child takes
the name of the parents

181
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.183
and becomes a full
member of the family.

182
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:15.621
- When we first came to work with Mi'Kmaw
Family, we were working with the province,

183
00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:22.188
and so we were kind of doing joint
services, there was only 23 of us in staff.

184
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.193
And there was only, I think there was
like, six or seven of us Social Workers.

185
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.478
And it was heartbreaking
for us because we sat there.

186
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.828
I read all the files, and
it took months to read them.

187
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:40.322
And we'd sit there and cry, you
know, because we knew these families,

188
00:15:40.364 --> 00:15:47.388
and there was very biased statements
or comments that were in the files.

189
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.948
And really, you know, we've seen that,
we've seen that there was no visits.

190
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.898
Mom didn't know
where the kids were.

191
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.038
There was no contact.

192
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.186
Children were not
seeing their parents.

193
00:15:57.228 --> 00:15:58.708
They were not seeing
their siblings.

194
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.038
They weren't told their rights.

195
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.748
There were no visits
between families.

196
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.328
We had siblings living in communities
that didn't even know their siblings.

197
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:13.338
And so we see that and we know
what the impacts are on separation.

198
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.428
- I believe that that what
we need is a new focus,

199
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.828
understanding that the
most important thing

200
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.358
is for kids to stay with their
family, with their loved ones.

201
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.913
It's not enough to just
move ahead, and support

202
00:16:25.955 --> 00:16:28.248
the healing from the
Residential Schools.

203
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.469
We need to reckon with what's
happening now, and keep families

204
00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:35.268
together, keep children with their
families and their communities now.

205
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.280
The dire need to
focus on keeping

206
00:16:37.322 --> 00:16:39.513
families together is a
collective community need.

207
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.038
Across the country, Indigenous
leaders are working hard

208
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.608
to focus on prevention, rather
than separation in order

209
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.831
to keep children at home
in their communities.

210
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.680
It's a way of cleansing
your mind, your body,

211
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.240
just prove that it, if you don't practice
just bring, at least bring a prayer,

212
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.190
bring some kind of
ritual into your home.

213
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.580
- I see you.

214
00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.042
I see me.

215
00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:38.598
He does the first thing
we all have to do,

216
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.018
we have to take that first
step to help ourselves

217
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.623
and he could pass on his other senses,
and he feels a way in the dark.

218
00:17:48.044 --> 00:17:51.283
Oh, what is that?

219
00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:53.411
It's a crow.

220
00:17:53.453 --> 00:17:54.483
It's a crow.

221
00:18:02.939 --> 00:18:03.939
- I can see.

222
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:18.483
- The children are asking for the stories,
they desire for that identity, who am I?

223
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.795
In fact, many of us older
individuals still ask ourselves,

224
00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:24.288
"Who am I?"

225
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.040
And those stories hold sacred truth,
sacred laws, universal laws, love.

226
00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:34.698
We've all come from love.

227
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:41.103
All people from this planet have come
from love although sometimes we forget.

228
00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:58.608
- As First Nations, we weren't considered
humans, so we couldn't have games?

229
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.848
And it was against us, a law for us
to gamble or practice witchcraft.

230
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.408
So they took all
this away from us.

231
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.848
But it was all underground.

232
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.108
I remember my grandmother.

233
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.298
She died in the '70s.

234
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.698
She had one, and it
was even cracked here.

235
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.805
But every time a car
would come over, she said.

236
00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:17.328
"Hide it, hide it."

237
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.908
And that was even in the
'60s, we still hide it.

238
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.774
It's very important
to teach the kids,

239
00:20:22.816 --> 00:20:26.238
because it has everything
to do with exercise.

240
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.378
You're exercising your body, your
hands, your mind, everything.

241
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.478
And it's teaching
you how to count.

242
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.878
And it's teaching you to
get along with people.

243
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.603
Sitting down, playing with no man,
it's hardly ever seen today, right?

244
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:46.308
Our people are so scattered and there's
so many of them that don't speak Mi'Kmaw.

245
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.472
And even to say that
they're not Mi'Kmaw and they

246
00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:53.028
said, "Oh interesting, here,
you know, they talking,"

247
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.778
you know, they don't even want
to know what you're talking.

248
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.298
I only went to work to
help the kids because

249
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.818
we had kids coming in
and we're teaching them

250
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.298
to be proud of themselves,
showing them games,

251
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.473
there's so much stuff there, and
to educate people off the reserve.

252
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.053
They still ask us, do you live
in Wigwams, do you live in Tipis?

253
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:22.276
They ask all these questions,
what they read in books,

254
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.628
and I guess from their
family, they bring it to us.

255
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.573
And some people don't even come because of
that, because they don't really know us.

256
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.598
When I left Membertou, most
of the people I grew up

257
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.748
with spoke Mi'kmaq but
after me, like my brother,

258
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.478
he's only two years younger
than me, he spoke English.

259
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.618
So all the kids in Membertou
mostly speak English.

260
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.098
To be proud, you have to be proud of
where you've been, and who you are.

261
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.778
You can't forget that.

262
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.468
And I always tell them,
"Speak your Mother Tongue,"

263
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:59.313
I said, because if we
lose it, Chinese can

264
00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:04.158
go China, and learn it,
French can go France.

265
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.738
If we lose our Mi'kmaq
language, where do we go?

266
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.968
This is it.

267
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.801
We can't go home.

268
00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:09.843
This is home.

269
00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:14.538
And I said, "Once we lose our
language, then we're White."

270
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.349
Our language has
been watered down

271
00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:03.460
since colonization, and
is now considered an

272
00:23:03.502 --> 00:23:05.782
English version of the
Mi'kmaq language, which is

273
00:23:05.824 --> 00:23:08.103
the key reason we are
losing our mother tongue.

274
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.218
As we ourselves learn, we
will in turn teach our kids

275
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.117
and anyone who is interested
in our proud heritage.

276
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.000
- What we've been teaching
our children for the last

277
00:23:22.042 --> 00:23:24.258
number of years is an
English version of Mi'Kmaw.

278
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.998
I don't know how a 54-year-old woman
could not know her own history.

279
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.428
I'm a Leader, I'm a Chief,
and I'm just learning it.

280
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.308
This is about, like teaching
our children our proud,

281
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.458
proud heritage, because
right now they don't know it

282
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.948
about how our people were
engineers, they were doctors.

283
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.628
They were out in the water and they were
fishing walrus, like it's all there.

284
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.348
It's all there hidden in our
beautiful, beautiful, Mi'Kmaw language.

285
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.428
I feel so strongly that
if we can unlock our

286
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.027
language, then our children,
they will be prouder,

287
00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:58.187
they will flourish
because when they go to

288
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:01.592
other places, they can
say, "Hi, I'm Mi'Kmaw."

289
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.338
- When I was taken away,
when I was real young,

290
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.238
it was at a time when
my mom had actually,

291
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.088
she attempted suicide,
and I had found her.

292
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.398
Because my mother also
was in the system.

293
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.208
It just kind of like we
kind of repeated itself.

294
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.138
I felt like it was like Residential School,
when I learned about Residential School,

295
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:50.343
when you got taken away, we were
cleaned, we were, hair was cut.

296
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.593
There was an actual sexual abuse
that happened while I was there.

297
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.288
So now for me in my life,
it's affected me as a mom

298
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.818
in a way that I'm constantly afraid, even
if I know I'm doing the right things.

299
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:14.141
I still am constantly afraid of the
fear that someone could even take

300
00:25:14.183 --> 00:25:19.863
my kid, or that I don't have power
to speak on behalf of my children.

301
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.880
It actually has made me a
really dominating parent.

302
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.328
That was one thing that was
never going to happen in my life.

303
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:40.297
And my babies were going to stay
with me, and forever than will be.

304
00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.618
Growing up, me and my friends had seen
a group come down to Lennox Island.

305
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.398
It was the first time I
ever seen an actual drum.

306
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.298
It was like, what is this?

307
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.758
The one thing that I always
can say that comes back

308
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.297
is about culture and how
much that has brought,

309
00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:18.438
started bringing peace
back to my soul almost,

310
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.258
into my spirit and saying that I belong
somewhere, and I'm a part of something.

311
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.818
Our culture is beautiful.

312
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.295
It heals people.

313
00:26:47.413 --> 00:26:49.518
- Well, it's all about
prevention, right?

314
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.728
And it's all about like
communities taking ownership

315
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.980
of our own children and
saying to the Federal

316
00:26:55.022 --> 00:26:57.738
Government, because really,
what's wrong here, right?

317
00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.148
It's a money thing, to me.

318
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.178
Like really, like help the
family, do the preventative

319
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.208
medicine and stuff, for all
that stuff in the family.

320
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.758
Like, why take a family,
take a child out of there

321
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.350
and then pay someone else
to look after that child?

322
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.588
Support the family.

323
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:17.148
It's not the Mi'Kmaw fault, it's not
anybody's fault that the people are poor.

324
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.884
We have had no access
to our resources.

325
00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:23.444
All of our traditional
ways were suppressed.

326
00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:26.283
So no wonder we're fucked up.

327
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.838
- First came news, from the
Attawapiskat First Nation

328
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.844
in Northern Ontario that 11 people had
tried to commit suicide in one day.

329
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.748
This is the fifth
state of emergency

330
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.298
Attawapiskat has declared
in the past 10 years.

331
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.068
Others were due to flooding, overcrowded
housing, and poor drinking water.

332
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.468
Exposure to the chemicals
in large quantities

333
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.828
over time can increase
the risk of cancer.

334
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.060
Tonight, Attawapiskat's Chief
said the crisis is all consuming.

335
00:27:59.406 --> 00:28:01.344
All you have to do is call the-

336
00:28:05.313 --> 00:28:08.067
Then you see the black.
The black is all mold.

337
00:28:08.109 --> 00:28:09.451
The black is all mold.

338
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.748
At a community forum, young
people pleaded for help.

339
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.378
The spiral brought on by
isolation, family breakdowns,

340
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.703
overcrowding and the rest of the
challenges facing most isolated reserves.

341
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.626
- I commit to action
now, I commit to lasting

342
00:28:36.668 --> 00:28:40.563
action, for the people
of Attawapiskat.

343
00:28:59.765 --> 00:29:06.223
I touch it, I touch it, I
touched it, I touched it.

344
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.518
- It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to see how the unacceptable reality,

345
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.788
or as many call it Third
World living conditions,

346
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.378
contribute to an environment
that is, you know,

347
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.058
is not supportive of
children and young people.

348
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.841
And that to me, is not
an individual failure

349
00:29:37.883 --> 00:29:40.623
by any means, it's by
far a systemic failure.

350
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.645
- So the problem with the water in
the community is that our THM levels

351
00:29:46.687 --> 00:29:51.468
are quite high, and they've been slowly
rising over the past several years.

352
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.578
So that has created a lot
of very serious worries

353
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.298
in a population, because when
you have such high levels,

354
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.018
you have to really limit your
contacts with this sort of water.

355
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.635
If you're taking a shower with it, you
have to have short shower, five minutes.

356
00:30:06.677 --> 00:30:11.148
Same if you're washing
dishes with your bare hands,

357
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.628
you should not be washing your
foods that you're going to cook.

358
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.658
You should not cook
with it because cooking,

359
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.686
boiling water concentrates the
chemicals, and makes it even worse

360
00:30:21.728 --> 00:30:25.713
and then it evaporates into the
air and you're breathing it in.

361
00:30:33.242 --> 00:30:36.618
- Me, me.
- Once, just like that, now you look.

362
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660
You see, it is red.

363
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.993
So now it's recording.

364
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.580
Yeah.

365
00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.309
Who is the fastest?

366
00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:48.309
Three two one, let's go.

367
00:30:55.050 --> 00:31:00.603
- I was able to learn about the
language, and learn about hunting.

368
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.868
And my siblings ended up in
foster care, all of them,

369
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.788
and we didn't see each
other too much later.

370
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.643
We didn't really know each other, because
we spent so much time apart as kids.

371
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.728
I came back in 2009 with my family
and came home to no housing,

372
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.883
like the housing shortage,
backlogged for like 15 years.

373
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.258
Without a house, you can't rest.

374
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.848
You don't feel safe.

375
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.108
It starts to take a toll on you
mentally, and everybody's crowded.

376
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.353
You know, it just wears you down,
you know, you start to get worn out.

377
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:51.063
- The biggest challenge that this country
faces in my view is First Nation's poverty.

378
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:56.058
Our people are too
poor, simply put.

379
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.908
There's a housing crisis in
First Nation communities.

380
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.601
It's a serious crisis, and we
need to do something about it.

381
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.835
- I thought it was just normal,
and then when I got older, and

382
00:32:10.877 --> 00:32:14.661
then when I left the community
to the South, for High School,

383
00:32:14.703 --> 00:32:18.457
I thought, "Well, you know, how
come everyone else has access

384
00:32:18.499 --> 00:32:22.190
to clean water, and certain
opportunities, and we don't."

385
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.438
- Now you think about what we do
in terms of non-Indigenous youth.

386
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.628
We make sure that they
have free public schools,

387
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.974
we make sure that they
go to high school.

388
00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:34.908
We hope that they will go
on to college or university.

389
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.098
But all of this education
is set up for them.

390
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.958
The same thing
applies to healthcare,

391
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.288
the same thing applies to
clean water and the housing.

392
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.128
These are not social programs,
these are not charity.

393
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.428
These are the building
blocks of a strong economy.

394
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.438
It's one we recognize
for ourselves.

395
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.748
It's time we start to
recognize it for the youngest

396
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.290
and the fastest growing
segment of our population.

397
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.720
- The dream of having
a midwifery program

398
00:33:00.762 --> 00:33:03.498
here took a long, long
time to come together.

399
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.318
I started working on this
in the '90s actually.

400
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.978
Midwifery was legislated
in Ontario 1993.

401
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.768
And there was a large portion
of these consultations

402
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.222
that were on Indigenous
midwifery and they have the

403
00:33:16.264 --> 00:33:19.608
right to decide what kind
of midwives they want,

404
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.068
what kind of training they
want the midwives to have.

405
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:26.178
So in bringing midwifery
back to Attawapiskat,

406
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.938
it was always very central that
we bring back Indigenous midwives.

407
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.218
So we want Cree-midwives
in this community.

408
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.478
We used to have Cree-midwives,
they were erased from this map.

409
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.098
And now we are
rewriting history.

410
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.998
When I came here, I was just
appalled that how women were treated.

411
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.108
And I really believe that it
was a woman's right to decide,

412
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:54.678
according to her reality,
what's her family situation,

413
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.868
who's her support
system, who are going

414
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.028
to be here with her children
if she has to leave.

415
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.265
And she has to take all
of this into account

416
00:34:02.307 --> 00:34:06.783
to make a decision as to where is the
best place, for her to give birth.

417
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.700
We always are very careful
to position our bodies lower

418
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.652
than the laboring woman,
because she is giving

419
00:34:17.694 --> 00:34:21.138
birth, and she's in
her full woman's power.

420
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.068
And we always ask
permission before we touch.

421
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.998
May I?

422
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.388
And we wait for her and people
are sometimes going, "What?

423
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:32.478
Like, I'm being
asked to be touched."

424
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.488
And I'm always very
mindful of that

425
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.223
that maybe I am the first one
who asked permission to touch.

426
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.493
I think it's an important piece
in a woman's healing journey also.

427
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:52.007
I think at the beginning of my
practice, I'm not sure if women

428
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:56.418
were using less, or if they
confided less, because we come

429
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.808
from the understanding
that the drug addiction,

430
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.528
it's not the addiction to
the drug that is the problem,

431
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:11.088
it is the trauma behind what makes you need
to numb that terrible voice in the back.

432
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.218
You need to numb it up, however.

433
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.118
So we try to approach
that instead of the drugs.

434
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.478
Addiction is a problem
of disconnection.

435
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.740
You have disconnected, because
you can't stay connected to that.

436
00:35:37.557 --> 00:35:43.488
- Attawapiskat really made headlines about
a week ago because it declared a state

437
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.798
of emergency after 11 people attempted
to take their own lives in one night.

438
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.668
- Over the last few days as the
cameras, and the politicians left,

439
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.913
there were more attempted suicides
by young people in Attawapiskat.

440
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.068
- I don't know, because they just
don't have enough activities here.

441
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.048
I mean, they're building
their youth center,

442
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.491
starting kids, I don't know
disproved in this town,

443
00:36:06.533 --> 00:36:08.578
because they buried
everything here.

444
00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:15.140
Every time I'm on Facebook, I always see
these depressed quotes, quotes, statuses.

445
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.053
There's nothing really in this
town, like nothing fun for the kids.

446
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.668
- The issue is we can't
be self-satisfied,

447
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.848
and we've got to recognize
that this is not a one shot

448
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.888
and then you think
about something else.

449
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.118
You're talking about the youngest, and the
fastest growing segment of your population.

450
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.228
What you've got to really do is
to make sure that they succeed.

451
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.398
If that generation succeeds, then I
think there will not be any back sliding.

452
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.193
But the important thing is to make sure
that in fact, we continue to progress.

453
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:55.464
- We're resilient and a
lot of us are trying our

454
00:36:55.506 --> 00:37:00.119
best to improve our lives
and continue to heal

455
00:37:00.161 --> 00:37:05.973
and making sure that our kids are
going to have a positive legacy.

456
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.563
One of the biggest, biggest mineral finds
in the entire world is right up the river.

457
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.868
You know, it's part of the treaties, how
do we find a way to maximize those things

458
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.600
that were given to us, but do
it in a way that's responsible?

459
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.608
Like the wind, because wind
never stops year-around.

460
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.888
You know, green energy,
that's, I think of right away.

461
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.738
You look at the
James Bay, the waves.

462
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.563
You can generate hydroelectricity through
ways, and there's so much potential.

463
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.998
When I look around here,
sometimes it's hard

464
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.703
to see all the good, because
you're just blinded by your tears.

465
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.820
- My mom died in
1988, I carried guilt.

466
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.188
That night my mom left
my granny's house I was

467
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:20.268
there, and she asked me
to go with her at first.

468
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.677
But then she said,
"Just wait for me."

469
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.293
Then she went missing, and they
found her body in the lake.

470
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.093
I used to think maybe if I went
with her, she would still be alive.

471
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.243
I never found out what happened.

472
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.533
But I've learned to live with
that, I've learned to accept that.

473
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.590
Out here during that time, it seemed,
there seemed like there was no help.

474
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.593
Like there was
nobody to turn to.

475
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.813
So I felt stuck.

476
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.588
So that was my way out, was to drink
because when I drank, I didn't care.

477
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.913
I didn't feel anything.

478
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:06.198
When I knew it was getting bad,
my drinking was getting bad,

479
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:10.855
I asked CFS for help, and that's
how they got involved in my life.

480
00:39:10.897 --> 00:39:15.477
"You're a mom, you need to
be strong for your kids."

481
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.569
Oh duh, that's what I'm
trying to do, because

482
00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:24.318
they would say, "Well, this is all for
the kids. This is all for the kids."

483
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.683
But it really wasn't.

484
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.598
If they would have said,
"This is all for the money,"

485
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.997
that would have been
the truth, because my

486
00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:34.623
kids were getting hurt
when they were in care.

487
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.818
They were in care
for six months.

488
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:44.078
The last time I got pregnant and she
said, "Are you sure you're going to be

489
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:50.337
able to take care of your kids and to
take care of this baby by yourself?"

490
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.928
And that's when the abortion,
because there was that thing,

491
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.110
if you don't want to lose
your kids do what we want.

492
00:40:11.574 --> 00:40:16.023
I went through the abortion and how am I
supposed to keep it together after that?

493
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:38.208
- The youth protection system was in
support of an intervention based system.

494
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.250
So there was plenty of
funding for workers to go in

495
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.848
and intervene in a family, and
potentially remove their family.

496
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.728
But there was not a lot
of resources in place

497
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.668
to help a family
before it got there.

498
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:56.808
So how do we start putting
those programs in place for it?

499
00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.648
And I think it's creativity
and the hard part

500
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.558
that we're working on and
we're making progress on

501
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:08.208
is allowing the community
room to think outside the box.

502
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.498
What can we put in place?

503
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.340
What kind of programs can we
put in place to allow that?

504
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.291
- There will come a point
in your life when you're

505
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:20.523
going to have to choose
which path you want to take.

506
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.372
All of the ceremonies
that used to be here,

507
00:41:25.414 --> 00:41:29.748
that used to be practiced
by my mother's family,

508
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.898
the Pipes, the Ceremonies, the
Sweat Lodges, the Sun dances,

509
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.702
all of those things, the
spirituality of our people.

510
00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:41.358
And we've really taken that
time to learn our culture,

511
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.498
to learn our ceremonial ways,
to learn some of our language.

512
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.560
And that, I think,
has been one of the

513
00:41:47.602 --> 00:41:49.998
contributing factors
into how we have managed

514
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.633
to change the impetus of this
organization, the Center,

515
00:41:55.470 --> 00:42:00.948
to reflect who we are as individuals,
and to transfer that healthy lifestyle,

516
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:05.208
that healthy outlook so that
we can make that change,

517
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.578
that needs to happen in
all of our communities,

518
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.098
to make it better
for our children,

519
00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:16.945
our children's children so that they don't
have to experience what we've experienced.

520
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.208
Manitoba has among the highest rates
of apprehension in the country.

521
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.931
Indigenous children
account for almost 90% of

522
00:42:25.973 --> 00:42:28.653
the 11,000 children in
the province's system.

523
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.597
- That had a tremendous
toll on, particularly

524
00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:36.515
the family structures
within the community

525
00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:42.018
and, of course, because of that you got
the despair, alcoholism was on the rise.

526
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.138
Domestic violence is on the
rise because of alcohol use.

527
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.418
Its breaking that cycle.

528
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.548
"I said, So how do we do this?"

529
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.098
And I'm like, "Well,
hold on, wait a second."

530
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.498
No one owns property on reserve.

531
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.978
So these houses technically
belong to the Chief of Council.

532
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.760
So, legal counsel, I
need you to draft me a

533
00:43:01.802 --> 00:43:05.990
VCR that authorizes our
workers who can remove

534
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.668
any person causing a child
to be need of protection

535
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.608
from the residence, but
that person has to come

536
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:19.908
and meet with our workers within 48 hours,
and then after that, there'll be decision

537
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.238
as to whether it to happen,
continue to be moved from there,

538
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.758
or they sit down in
a circle meeting,

539
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.360
and they start talking about how
to keep this family unit together.

540
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.508
- I know they're coming home.

541
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.233
Nobody has to tell me that.

542
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:40.353
I said, when they come home, I know
that I'll be ready to take care of them.

543
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.288
And when they came home,
I took them everywhere

544
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.708
I went because I had
to earn their trust,

545
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:52.158
because it's easy to say,
I'm sorry to anybody,

546
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.948
but to earn that trust
again and to show somebody

547
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.328
that they can trust you,
especially your own child,

548
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.903
it takes a lot of work.

549
00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.643
My youngest one brought a
drum home for me one day,

550
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:12.708
because I had a drum, I was told that
I had to go get it blessed in a sweat.

551
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.578
So I went, I had to go.

552
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:22.668
I don't know how to sing, I don't know
anything about this, but they taught me.

553
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.913
The women taught me.

554
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.686
And I think that Medicine
is very important

555
00:44:28.728 --> 00:44:32.990
because the physical,
the mental, the emotional

556
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.440
and the spiritual, it helps all
four parts of a human being.

557
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.768
Launching off their
canoe from the shores

558
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.998
of Washington state, the
youths from Kwùmut Lelum Child

559
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.333
and Family Services in British Columbia
make their way to Lummi Island.

560
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.118
It is a moment where they can
reconnect with their people,

561
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.359
water, land and their
Ancestors, building the strong

562
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:08.600
foundation needed, for
their own journeys in life.

563
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.487
- You are my friend,
you are my family.

564
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:45.786
For the generosity, for
the lords that allow we are

565
00:45:45.828 --> 00:45:50.872
grateful, we are humble,
and we get to be your guest.

566
00:45:52.274 --> 00:45:55.402
But now it is time for
us to carry on, so we

567
00:45:55.444 --> 00:45:58.939
ask humbly for permission
that we may carry on.

568
00:46:01.057 --> 00:46:04.878
- All these kids that I paddle
with were all kids in care.

569
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.005
So we barely know who we are

570
00:46:07.047 --> 00:46:10.818
and we don't know where we come
from, and where our roots are.

571
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.732
And its the same question
every year, where are you from?

572
00:46:14.774 --> 00:46:17.718
Who's your grandparents,
who's your parents?

573
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.238
And then just that little
bit of information,

574
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.648
we can travel way back to our Ancestors,
and we can figure out who we are.

575
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:30.933
There's no words to describe how I
feel because I feel it in the moment,

576
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.854
going through my own
battle, being in the system.

577
00:46:34.896 --> 00:46:41.403
So this year, I'm just here, and I'm
trying to get over a rough patch.

578
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:48.723
It's crazy how one year can change
one person, even in just a few months.

579
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.798
- These are children in care,
so there's a big void there.

580
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.910
People feel it many various
different ways, but I

581
00:46:57.952 --> 00:47:01.473
believe this is the proper
way to do it, with culture.

582
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.078
It's a lot, it's a
lot of happiness,

583
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.908
it's a lot of tears, a lot
of anger and for a big thing

584
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.600
and it's a big break from all the
hurt, and pain that we feel at home.

585
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:21.941
So for here, it's just a big relief, and
just be on the canoe and feel so connected

586
00:47:21.983 --> 00:47:25.353
with the water and
connected with ourselves.

587
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:31.158
- A lot of these kids aren't as
exposed to culture as they should be.

588
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.818
It's just where we come from, it's
what has been happening on these lands

589
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.548
for thousands of years,
when that really hits you

590
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:43.068
and you fully understand what's
going on, it's a very special moment.

591
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:46.008
You know, I thought I was the
toughest 14-year-old around,

592
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:47.938
but there was lots of
moments where I was

593
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.148
absolutely balling my
eyes out, doing protocol,

594
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:54.108
doing the drumming and the singing,
and all that kind of stuff.

595
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.338
I was a troubled kid.

596
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.248
There's many different
ways that could have gone.

597
00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.098
If I didn't experience
that at that tender age,

598
00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.318
I don't know where I
would be right now.

599
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.358
I don't even want
to think about it.

600
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.198
And that's really what
the journey is about.

601
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.443
It's a healing journey.

602
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.870
Indigenous people
have faced a lot of

603
00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:16.341
hardships, so this is
where we come to heal.

604
00:48:16.383 --> 00:48:19.293
- This experience isn't
in my everyday life.

605
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:24.498
Every year, I find new
friends and meet new people,

606
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.928
and I don't even see
them until the next year.

607
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.543
For a certain amount of time, it's a
little bit of a goodbye until next year.

608
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.998
Our Elders are our teachers.

609
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.758
They know our teachings,
and they pass it down to us.

610
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.058
So us, as youth and kids,
for the next generation

611
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:46.100
of our people, I found
my voice on journeys,

612
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.678
I figure out who
I was on journeys.

613
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.308
And for me, it's something
that I crave every year

614
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.843
and something I need
for myself to help me.

615
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.243
It's my medicine.

616
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.433
I get healing out of it.

617
00:49:01.173 --> 00:49:04.473
For a child in care, it's a
good way to find identity.

618
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:09.131
We're all supposed to be one
paddle, one mind and one heart.

619
00:49:09.173 --> 00:49:12.810
Even if it's just one paddle
that stops, I can feel that.

620
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:49.267
How do you say, "I love you"?

621
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.825
Again.

622
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.200
Again.

623
00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:04.097
- When we first went to cultural camp, we
do this thing where we introduce ourselves

624
00:51:04.139 --> 00:51:07.698
and say where we're from,
and what clan we're from.

625
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.418
For the longest time, we were
saying we were from Frog Clan.

626
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.895
And then one of our family members that we
ran into at culture camp actually told us,

627
00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:18.344
"No, you're not, you're
Bear Clan, because

628
00:51:18.386 --> 00:51:21.198
that's where your Mom and
your Grandma are from."

629
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.978
And from then on, we're
like, "We're Bear Clan."

630
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.328
That's Christine and Bradley.

631
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:28.098
That's our youngest brother.

632
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.058
That's him there, too.

633
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:34.100
- He's not here right now, he
is downtown living his life.

634
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:38.987
He just got off a
probation, so he is living.

635
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:43.338
- These are some
pictures and memories

636
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.978
of when we were living
in the group home.

637
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.498
They built for us, Carrier
Sekani made it just for us.

638
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.568
- Carrier Sekani,
they built a house.

639
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.401
All wasn't built.

640
00:51:51.443 --> 00:51:55.878
It was just they bought one
for all of us to live in there

641
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.398
as a family because they
didn't want to separate us.

642
00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.440
- I remember we got dropped
off at this group home,

643
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.726
and my parents told us
that they'd be back in

644
00:52:05.768 --> 00:52:07.863
two weeks, and it just
never really happened.

645
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.918
Were you waiting for them?

646
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.960
Yeah.

647
00:52:14.346 --> 00:52:17.730
What should we get?

648
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.891
You choose.

649
00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:23.458
Well they don't have Dr. Pepper,
so that's out of the question.

650
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.383
Ooh Dr. Pepper, gross.

651
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:29.590
- Canada Dry.

652
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:38.555
- We were told that they were
sick, for the longest time

653
00:52:38.597 --> 00:52:42.798
until we were old enough to
understand why we got taken away.

654
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.908
It was because they're drug
addicts and alcoholics.

655
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:50.763
We were abused quite bad.

656
00:52:53.717 --> 00:52:58.188
- It was like three-years-old
when I first got hit.

657
00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:00.603
I remember it because
it was over a burger,

658
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.541
I didn't eat my whole burger, I
only ate like two, or three bites.

659
00:53:04.583 --> 00:53:06.162
I was freaking three-years-old.

660
00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:09.978
I didn't have a big stomach
so my dad, he kind of got mad.

661
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.458
He grabbed the coffee table
leg and smoked me in the head.

662
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.918
Got bunch of scars in
the head because of it.

663
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.933
- We would go to school,
and then we would be at

664
00:53:17.975 --> 00:53:19.848
school, and we would cry
because we didn't want

665
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.248
to go back home because
if we went back home,

666
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.129
we would either get hit
or we wouldn't eat food,

667
00:53:25.171 --> 00:53:27.828
or we wouldn't even be
able to drink water.

668
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.698
So I mean, my sister would drink water
out of, like, an old hair spray bottle,

669
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.340
like squirt each others'
tongues, like, three times.

670
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.703
What day is it today?

671
00:53:42.745 --> 00:53:43.745
29th.

672
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.620
- We should be fine, right?

673
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:53.178
It's good.

674
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.278
We told each other that we're not
going to end up like our parents.

675
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.988
We're not going to end up like the
stereotypical native person that ends up

676
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.888
on the streets or as a drug
addict or an alcoholic.

677
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:09.333
We learn to reach out.

678
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.248
- There's been times when
we are like we haven't been,

679
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.218
so close, but we just kind
of have to push through that-

680
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.488
- Yeah, go through
our own little thing.

681
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:23.058
- At the end of the day,
there's only us that we have.

682
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.100
- Yeah.

683
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:29.598
For the longest time,
growing in and out of care,

684
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.348
up until year nine, we were
separated a lot of the time.

685
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:38.178
So Kristine and Sheldon would
always go and Foster Home with them.

686
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.733
And then I would either, like,
be by myself or with Bradley.

687
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:47.075
- Stay positive,
that's all, you know.

688
00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:50.327
You don't, my parents,
they're drug addicts.

689
00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.148
It gets really hard.

690
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:04.983
You just, you just want
your parents, you know.

691
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.888
- Family is very important.

692
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.163
Being together is way more important,
because you don't have anybody else, right.

693
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.873
And if I think that if
we were all separated,

694
00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:22.578
we probably wouldn't
be as good as we are.

695
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.008
- Because we know so many youth

696
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:29.778
that were our age a little bit younger,
and they aren't doing well at all.

697
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:36.348
There's only a few of us, a few handful
of us that made it out well, you know, and

698
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:42.918
some of the kids that we went to camp
with, we see and it's pretty hard to see.

699
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.080
- That's correct.

700
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.798
Samantha Metcalfe and
Cailyn Degrandpre,

701
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.127
11-year-old Inuit Throat singers
from the Ottawa Inuit Children

702
00:56:10.169 --> 00:56:13.350
Center will now come forward
to share their music with us.

703
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.463
- Throat Singing is
traditionally done by two women,

704
00:56:29.505 --> 00:56:32.448
or girls, whoever laughs
or messes up first loses.

705
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.548
It's very important to us
to stay with our culture,

706
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.638
even though we're down
South compared to up North.

707
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.621
Ottawa has one of the
biggest Inuit communities

708
00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:43.218
around Canada then
other than up North.

709
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.528
And it's just very
important, so the kids

710
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.838
down here can learn
about their culture too.

711
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.168
The reason why we Throat Sing is because
back in Residential School times,

712
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.498
Throat Team was banned and now we're
proud to be bringing back our culture.

713
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.527
We're Inuit and proud.

714
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:17.030
- I was a co-Founder of the Inuit
Specific Healing Center here in Ottawa.

715
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.950
So one of the things
I came up with was

716
00:57:21.992 --> 00:57:26.960
implementing Inuit history
as a therapeutic tool.

717
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:52.008
I was born on the land, born in the middle
of winter, and my members are wonderful,

718
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:56.418
because you're surrounded
by adults that really care

719
00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.757
for you, not just your
mom and dad, but the

720
00:57:59.799 --> 00:58:03.648
whole camp would kind of
look out for the child.

721
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:08.208
So that's where my world began.

722
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:13.008
When I was about
six-years-old, my family

723
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:18.558
from this peaceful existence was
forcefully moved by the Government.

724
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.058
It must have been a horrible
day for our parents.

725
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.648
They lost a lot.

726
00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:30.303
They were not allowed to bring
anything of their personal possessions.

727
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.608
Somebody tried to go back
to their original camp

728
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.773
and they found everything
was demolished.

729
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.528
They also lost their
means of transportation.

730
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:47.448
The dogs that were slaughtered,

731
00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:53.268
dogs were their friends,
their guide and protectors.

732
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:59.613
When they were slaughtered, I
think it really damaged our men.

733
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.720
Life just changed so drastically
that I think we're still

734
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:10.188
trying to figure a lot
of things out for us.

735
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:15.230
I did go through identity
crisis as a young person.

736
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.388
I had to find me and I'm
proud to be an Inuit.

737
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.793
That's who I am.

738
01:00:18.367 --> 01:00:23.538
- I described Nunavut often as
a place where time stands still.

739
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.798
We're at the top of the
world and when you come here,

740
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.586
if you're willing to
stop and listen, there is

741
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:35.373
so much life and so much
good in the community.

742
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.208
I am Inuit.

743
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:43.250
I grew up in Nunavut, lived and
worked most of my life here.

744
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.478
We have one of the most extreme
environments, probably in the world.

745
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.178
We are quite close
to the North Pole.

746
01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:01.068
So if you can imagine how we
live here in wooden houses,

747
01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:04.233
but yet we're in today,
it's minus 30, minus

748
01:01:04.275 --> 01:01:07.398
40, maybe even colder
with the wind chill.

749
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.488
Sometimes the health of
our children is at risk.

750
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:15.258
They're born with conditions
that require specialized care,

751
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.278
and we don't have all
of that in Nunavut.

752
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.458
So a lot of our children
with high medical needs

753
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:28.278
often are needed to be placed in
medical foster homes in the South.

754
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.689
In a year, we'll have about 70 to
80 children placed out of territory.

755
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:40.158
In a small community, we
don't have victim support,

756
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.938
we don't have addiction
services in every community.

757
01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:50.448
There is so much that a community
needs to build within their services.

758
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:57.288
What's missing is the resourcing, and it
relies heavily on the Government of Nunavut

759
01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:02.921
and so there are several departments
kind of eying on the same pots of money.

760
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:11.935
- For me when I go on the land, just
the solitude I feel, it's insane.

761
01:02:11.977 --> 01:02:15.048
I don't even feel alone when
I'm alone, because I know like,

762
01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:19.608
spirits are with us always,
culturally teaching.

763
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:23.343
Our culture is not only important
to healing, but it's also important

764
01:02:23.385 --> 01:02:27.078
as, like, being more proactive than
reactive to stuff that's going on,

765
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.823
because if you're getting the
youth out there, and doing

766
01:02:29.865 --> 01:02:32.568
things culturally, they are
just taking their mind off

767
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.219
of doing things negative,
you know, like, there's

768
01:02:35.261 --> 01:02:37.650
almost nothing to do
in our isolation here.

769
01:02:38.527 --> 01:02:41.268
- I had read about
ice roads before.

770
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.198
I had read about some of the
remote areas of the country,

771
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.558
but it's one thing to read about
it, it's another thing to go there.

772
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.858
- That remote reality
can be very challenging.

773
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.268
Yes, it's more expensive to get
materials there, to build there.

774
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.998
But I would also say the
Federal Government benefits

775
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.238
from out of sight,
out of mind mentality,

776
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.848
where a lot of Canada
doesn't know that reality,

777
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.733
and sometimes, unfortunately,
it doesn't seem to care.

778
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.888
In Nunavut, nearly a quarter
of all deaths have been

779
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:17.058
by suicide, which is one of
the highest rates in the world.

780
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:23.508
- We had about 35 suicides through our 26
communities in the span of a few months.

781
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:28.938
I lost several of my best friends,
cousins, close family members.

782
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.898
I have a tattoo going up my
arm that has the owl feather

783
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.078
and the owls, like our
spirit God to our next life.

784
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.514
And I have owl feather with birds
coming out of the feather and all

785
01:03:39.556 --> 01:03:43.312
those birds represent my friends,
and family that I've lost to suicide,

786
01:03:43.354 --> 01:03:46.878
but I gave up filling my arm, to
be honest because there's too many,

787
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.390
I didn't want a reminder every
time I was getting a tattoo done.

788
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.538
I left, to be honest, I couldn't
stand being in the North

789
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.718
and I moved to Ottawa, and I
stayed there for a few years.

790
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.203
When I came back and... we need Government
help really, and we don't get that.

791
01:04:08.213 --> 01:04:10.008
I don't even know
how to explain.

792
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.738
We have beer and wine stores opening that
are making millions of dollars a year

793
01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.420
off our people, but we still don't even
have an addiction treatment center.

794
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.570
- I tell people when you're
looking for discrimination,

795
01:04:24.612 --> 01:04:27.408
it's not just what you see,
it's what you don't see.

796
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.168
When you walk into a
First Nations community

797
01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.988
where there's been the ravages
of multigenerational trauma

798
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.888
from Residential Schools and
people are using addictions

799
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:41.868
to self-medicate, then where
are all the addiction services?

800
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:47.514
Why are all these fancy treatment centers
only available to people off reserve?

801
01:04:47.556 --> 01:04:50.058
There should be the best
culturally based treatment

802
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.233
in those communities,
and it's not there.

803
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.490
- Hi from Nunavut, Canada.

804
01:04:55.532 --> 01:05:01.398
While I have your attention, I just want
to bring to light the fact that Inuit

805
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.359
are nine times more
likely to commit suicide

806
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.978
than non-Indigenous
people in Canada.

807
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.848
- The way my girlfriend was
doing things on TikTok, it works.

808
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:13.258
Social media is what's
keeping us connected, and

809
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.618
I feel like the more
you know what's going on

810
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.918
with other people, the more we can relate,
and the more we can help each other.

811
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.568
- We keep losing our people
and I just want you guys

812
01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:29.463
to know Indigenous make First Nations
you are not alone, and you are loved.

813
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:34.083
- I want our people
to be able to prosper.

814
01:05:34.966 --> 01:05:36.921
It's kind of a weird
reference, but you're like,

815
01:05:36.963 --> 01:05:39.018
you know, have you seen
the movie "Black Panther"?

816
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.658
You know, if the Wakanda being
like the sacred gem of Africa?

817
01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.743
I kind of want Nunavut become
like the Wakanda of Canada.

818
01:05:44.785 --> 01:05:46.668
I want us to be
like a sacred gem

819
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.248
of empowerment
where they're able

820
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:51.303
to help all their
people in need.

821
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.058
- It's a way of life.

822
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:06.168
We're only as strong
as our weakest link.

823
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:08.928
So it's about our
most vulnerable.

824
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:12.571
Some people weren't
given the right chance,

825
01:06:12.613 --> 01:06:15.498
and so that's what
it's always been about,

826
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.823
is our community
is most vulnerable.

827
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:23.088
- Despite the advancements
and there are many

828
01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:26.058
and there are successes,
I also hear that things

829
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.223
are getting worse,
because as the population

830
01:06:28.265 --> 01:06:30.288
grows, as there are
more young families,

831
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:35.330
the demands on a system that
is broken are increasing.

832
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:38.568
And so what I hear is that
housing is getting worse.

833
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:40.938
The lack of support for
post-secondary education

834
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.818
is getting worse because
the challenges are growing.

835
01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.328
And more often than not,
the Federal Government

836
01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.718
is continuing very
similar policies

837
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.318
and not actually working
with communities the way

838
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.868
they need to and not
funding communities

839
01:06:56.910 --> 01:07:00.086
the way they need to
actually make a difference.

840
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.118
- Children are the
keepers of the possible,

841
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.563
and they're also experts
in love and fairness.

842
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.688
And they are the ones
who often call us up

843
01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:14.280
to be better people than
who we thought we could be

844
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.723
and a better country
than we think we are.

845
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.410
It's for all the children
who are in foster

846
01:07:23.452 --> 01:07:26.118
care right now and the
ones who grew up there.

847
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.906
I think it's important
that we say here that

848
01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:29.888
there are some children
that need to be removed

849
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.718
from their families because
of safety in their homes,

850
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.315
but not at the overrepresented
rates we see now, for

851
01:07:35.357 --> 01:07:38.216
First Nation children, they're
more likely to be removed

852
01:07:38.258 --> 01:07:40.964
to six to eight times a
rate, for reasons that we can

853
01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:43.713
prevent, poverty, poor
housing, and substance misuse.

854
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.041
The number of First Nations
children entering a child welfare

855
01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:53.470
care between 1995, and 2001
increased to staggering 71.5%.

856
01:07:54.516 --> 01:07:56.763
Now, that sounds
like a big number.

857
01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.608
But when I hear it, I think of only the
little kids that those things represent.

858
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:04.008
You see, together, it
meant that they had spent

859
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:06.275
over two million nights
away from their families,

860
01:08:06.317 --> 01:08:11.003
away from their teddy bears, away from
their language and away from their culture.

861
01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.278
- Because of all of the
inter-generational trauma caused

862
01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.339
by Residential Schools,
the number one reason

863
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:26.028
why kids were being taken away by
Social Workers is because of poverty.

864
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:28.098
We've had a crisis
for a long time now.

865
01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.388
Imagine we're 4% of the
population, but 50% of all kids

866
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.748
in foster care in this
country are Indigenous.

867
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:39.798
And then think of the percentage of
those who go murdered and missing.

868
01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.138
- To Manitoba now, where
report into the death

869
01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.928
of Tina Fontaine was
released earlier today.

870
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:50.238
She is the 15-year-old whose body was
pulled from Winnipeg's Red River in 2014.

871
01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.448
The report says Tina was
let down by the very system

872
01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:56.388
of services and supports that
were supposed to protect her.

873
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.758
It was a grizzly discovery that sent
shock waves through our community.

874
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:05.020
- Her murder, you know, was a point in time
that I believe really created an earthquake

875
01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:10.518
of sorts in our country around the issue
of missing, and murdered Indigenous women.

876
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.828
Two days after Tina's
body was discovered,

877
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:16.728
thousands of people marched
in memory of the slain teen.

878
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:19.518
- Not much do our
people ever get justice.

879
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.708
We're in the middle
of a national crisis.

880
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.738
- It was like every other
day there is a new story

881
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.978
about an Indigenous woman, girl or
Two-Spirit person who was missing.

882
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.838
Body was found, search is still
happening those kind of things.

883
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.273
But no one was talking
about it because it

884
01:09:32.315 --> 01:09:34.938
had been, so normalized,
oh, just another one.

885
01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.199
So if you're a Serial Killer
or even if you're not a

886
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.718
Serial Killer, you want to kill
women, who are you going to target?

887
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.011
You know, they found her in a car
15-years-old with some strange man.

888
01:09:45.053 --> 01:09:46.760
They didn't check
to see her age, they

889
01:09:46.802 --> 01:09:48.828
didn't check to see,
she was already on list.

890
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:51.738
- All the systems that were
to protect Tina failed her.

891
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.728
- We love Tina, and we will
show her how much we love her.

892
01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.713
- We all feel it because
it could have been our

893
01:09:58.755 --> 01:10:01.698
daughter, it could have
been our granddaughter.

894
01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.913
We don't want this to
continue, we want it to stop.

895
01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:05.748
Justice.

896
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:09.305
- - Tragic violence that
Indigenous women, and

897
01:10:09.347 --> 01:10:12.783
girls have experienced
amounts to genocide.

898
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.498
- Their killings
have mobilized many.

899
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:19.098
They've made it clear that there is
no reconciliation without justice.

900
01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:23.028
So today we call for love, for
Tina; for justice for Tina.

901
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.098
And we call on the Federal
Government to commit

902
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.888
to fundamental change so
that no Indigenous woman

903
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:31.993
and no Indigenous man go missing
or are murdered ever again.

904
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.558
- Change has occurred
because the Canada was forced

905
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.003
to change through a
Human Rights decision.

906
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:48.078
That opened up doors of acknowledging
that the System is not working.

907
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.988
If we're not dealing
with the community change

908
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:56.268
that's necessary, all of our people are
just going to be continually moved out.

909
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:58.263
That system needs to change.

910
01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:00.708
Let's have our own system.

911
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.258
And to me, that's true self
determination, you know,

912
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:07.488
that's really us deciding how do
we want to care, for our children.

913
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:09.888
And it's not up to Quebec
or Canada to do that.

914
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.868
It really is up
to our own nation.

915
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:16.338
- For a century now, based
on discriminatory policies

916
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:22.248
of Government, we have been taking
children away from their families.

917
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:27.175
It started with Residential Schools,
it continued in the '60s Scoop

918
01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:31.953
and still today, children are
being taken from their families.

919
01:11:33.348 --> 01:11:37.938
And this legislation marks a
turning point to say no more.

920
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:41.161
- Prevention in the truest
sense of a word, meaning that

921
01:11:41.203 --> 01:11:44.268
children do not ever enter
the Child Welfare System.

922
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:48.108
So if our goal is to not only
keep children in communities,

923
01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:52.608
but to keep children from entering the
Child Welfare System at all, communities

924
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:58.145
must have the right to Self-Determine
what that looks like for them.

925
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.193
Mary Teegee from
Takla Nation has been

926
01:12:11.235 --> 01:12:14.328
an advocate, for Indigenous
rights for over 20 years.

927
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:18.888
She has worked to advance
self-determination, and self-governance.

928
01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:22.008
The importance of culture at
the forefront of her mission.

929
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:25.008
And now, for the first
time in colonized history,

930
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:28.458
under bill C-92,
Indigenous communities

931
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.673
across the country have the opportunity
to develop, and implement their own laws.

932
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:08.988
- I am Gitxsan, and I am
a proud Bear Lake Gitxsan.

933
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:13.038
In order to know where you're going,
you have to know where we've been.

934
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.238
So if you think about
pre-contact times, how we used

935
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.998
to take care of our
children, we took care

936
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.528
of our children in community,
the whole old saying,

937
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.278
of course the saying, it takes
a community to raise a child.

938
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.933
Well, we live that, we lived
by our Ayook, we live by

939
01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:39.588
our Potlatch Laws, and that's
what maintains balance.

940
01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:42.153
We had holistic
balance, pre-contact.

941
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.578
And I think I always say
this, one of the first impacts

942
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.783
of Residential
School is heartbreak.

943
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:51.588
It is not your fault.

944
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:55.803
It is not our fault for
all the atrocities that

945
01:13:55.845 --> 01:14:00.018
have occurred and how
the societal ails that,

946
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.818
all of the issues that we're dealing with,
it's not our fault, may not be our fault,

947
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:10.533
but it is our collective responsibility
to fix that, to heal from that.

948
01:14:30.918 --> 01:14:35.337
- And when we talk about those
Ancestors, we will be the

949
01:14:35.379 --> 01:14:39.717
Ancestors of those not yet
born, because we are going

950
01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:43.850
to be taken back our rightful
place as the decision

951
01:14:43.892 --> 01:14:48.558
makers in our children, and
families lives long overdue.

952
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.958
And that's what we're
celebrating today.

953
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.343
When we blow those feathers
in front of the Federal

954
01:14:53.385 --> 01:14:55.728
Government, in front of
the Provincial Government,

955
01:14:55.770 --> 01:15:00.708
in front of all our leaders,
it is with the best intent,

956
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.843
it is for our children
and those not yet born.

957
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.800
- And so today, after all
the decades of fighting,

958
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:13.488
as of June 20th, a Federal
enabling legislation

959
01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:18.723
was passed so that we can assume authority
of our own children and families.

960
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:23.688
No longer will you be
under the Provincial Child

961
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.238
and Family Community
Services Act.

962
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.778
What you're going to be signing today is
a historic document that's going to state

963
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.468
that you are going to make
your own Gitxsan laws,

964
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.093
and that will be
the law of the land.

965
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:45.170
- No longer will a child be
ripped away from their family,

966
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.588
their clans, their
community, and their lands

967
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:53.328
where they have the right, the
innate the God given right to be.

968
01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.798
So long from time from
now, 100 years from now,

969
01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.728
they will remember this day and
they will say remember them,

970
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.833
remember those Ancestors
of days gone by that

971
01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:07.938
fought, for our children
that fought for us

972
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.980
so that we can grow up in the
warm embrace of our culture,

973
01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:16.663
of our land, of our families,
where we rightfully belong.

974
01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.467
That in this day
we're starting today.

975
01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.628
Funding is absolutely critical.

976
01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:10.278
And along with that is ensuring that
again, it's a First Nations led process.

977
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.658
Anything that is directed by the Federal
Government is not what communities need.

978
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.058
We have a history of the
Federal Government saying

979
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.183
that they know best when it comes to
First Nations, and it's a dark history.

980
01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:26.568
This isn't about charity, help
rescuing First Nations kids.

981
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:31.398
This is about co-creating a
society where every kid counts.

982
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:38.840
Every kid is worth the money, and we're
all richer when everyone's differences

983
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.618
are not overcome, but
they're celebrated.

984
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.448
Recognize their skill base,
recognize their understanding.

985
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:50.118
And when you do that, the can
take it, they take it over

986
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.160
and you succeed because it's
their program, not ours.

987
01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:58.338
I think this program is
wonderful to bring them

988
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.168
and get them away
from that environment

989
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:03.918
and show them something
else and give them a chance.

990
01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.878
Give them a fighting chance because that's
all we're about, giving them a chance.

991
01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.555
This river, this land is
what's going to teach them.

992
01:18:12.597 --> 01:18:14.538
We got to bring them.

993
01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.754
We got to bring them,
maybe kicking and

994
01:18:16.796 --> 01:18:19.308
screaming sometimes,
but we got to bring them

995
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:26.853
because it's all about knowing who you
are, and being proud of who you are.

996
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.755
Justin Trudeau made
the announcement from

997
01:18:42.797 --> 01:18:45.381
Rideau Cottage, Friday, saying
the initiative will result

998
01:18:45.423 --> 01:18:50.418
in fewer kids in care and will
reunite Indigenous families.

999
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.937
- Our Government is investing $542
million to Indigenous communities

1000
01:18:55.979 --> 01:19:01.128
to exercise full jurisdiction
over Child and Family Services.

1001
01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:04.158
This is vital to moving
forward on our promise

1002
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.654
to address the unacceptable
injustices that too many

1003
01:19:07.696 --> 01:19:11.013
kids and families have
faced in the care system.

1004
01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:07.462
- Just the history of
who First Nations people

1005
01:20:07.504 --> 01:20:10.878
are, and what we've
suffered is not known.

1006
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.405
So that alone trying to
get that out there and say,

1007
01:20:13.447 --> 01:20:19.308
"No, there really was attempts at
assimilation. This is what happened."

1008
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:23.250
When we don't face those truths, it's
hard then to make concrete change.

1009
01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:27.558
- Indigenous people have always
said that whatever you do,

1010
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.703
your actions, you must think seven
generations down, it will carry on.

1011
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:38.568
But there's also the
power of healing through

1012
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:41.748
different actions and
different experiences

1013
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:47.388
in your life where you can actually
clean up some of this all schmuck.

1014
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.928
- If there's ever a key
in prevention, it truly

1015
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:55.970
is teaching our ways, and
then it's okay to be Mi'Kmaw,

1016
01:20:56.647 --> 01:21:00.153
it's okay to be Cree,
it's okay to be Mohawk.

1017
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:06.628
That we are just as important
as anyone else in this world.

1018
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:16.736
It is the children that count,
and they rely on us to ensure

1019
01:21:16.778 --> 01:21:20.253
that they have all the opportunities
to reach their full potential.

1020
01:21:26.733 --> 01:21:29.868
I want to see them not
growing up and having

1021
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:32.268
to recover from
their childhoods,

1022
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:34.848
that being First Nations
doesn't hold them back,

1023
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.128
that it's a foothold of
them being successful

1024
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:38.470
in whatever that dream is.

1025
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:43.938
- We have to open this up
to the world, we have to.

1026
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.518
When we are proud and
our kids, then our kids

1027
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.610
will see that and the
kids will be proud.

1028
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.718
- The more efforts that we
can do in support filming,

1029
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.760
radio, books, knowledge,
having dialogues in the Senate,

1030
01:21:59.173 --> 01:22:03.108
when you have a First
Nations person stand up

1031
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:07.608
or a non-First Nations person
speak Mohawk in the middle

1032
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:10.227
of Parliament, which had
never happened before.

1033
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.658
- Those kinds of
efforts bring awareness.

1034
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.008
And the more awareness
we can have, the greater

1035
01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:31.308
chance we have of
actually realizing change.

1036
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:32.538
- Are we where we should be?

1037
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.888
No.

1038
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.509
But have we made huge
strides and better than most?

1039
01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:39.137
I think we have over
the course of the last

1040
01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:42.200
number of years, but we've
got a long way to go.

1041
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.948
It is not just about reducing
the number of children in care.

1042
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:52.548
It is about creating healthy
communities that support everyone.

1043
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:57.858
Giving them equal access to health
services, a safe home, and culture.

1044
01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.528
In order to do this, we
must ensure that funding

1045
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:05.718
in the future is secure and approached
holistically, for generations to come.

1046
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.038
- So that these families

1047
01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.448
and these children can
grow up safely together

1048
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:13.938
and deal with the
challenges they have,

1049
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:19.203
but in a way where they really
honors who they are, that's magic.

1050
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.138
- We can't say how we
feel other than grateful,

1051
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.508
because at one point,
the Government was trying

1052
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:29.616
to take this away from
us, trying to take.

1053
01:23:29.658 --> 01:23:33.423
As it's worded, it's trying
to take the Indian out of us.

1054
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.768
So we're grateful that we
even still have our culture,

1055
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:38.268
and we still have our languages,

1056
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:42.558
and we still have our songs,
and we still have our people,

1057
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.600
because our people went through
a tremendous battle just

1058
01:23:47.687 --> 01:23:51.170
for us to be here today
and to have our culture.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.760
'..Wind southwest. Rain at times...'

2
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.550
"Waste no more time arguing
about what a good man should be.

3
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.830
"Be one." Marcus Aurelius.

4
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.390
Have you been running?

5
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.150
Are you OK? There was
a call for you, at the office.

6
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.920
From your doctor.

7
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.120
Did he leave an address?

8
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.360
Draught!

9
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.270
Fancy a week
in Ancient Mesopotamia...

10
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.070
followed by future Mars?

11
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.270
Will there be cocktails?

12
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.150
On the moon.

13
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.870
The moon'll do!

14
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520
Ha-ha!

15
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.150
How's the new job?
Teach anything good?

16
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.470
No. Learn anything?

17
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.190
Not a thing.

18
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.830
What's happening?
Whoa, whoa. We're taking off.

19
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.400
But the engines aren't going!

20
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.310
'Windmill 11 to Greyhound Leader.

21
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.230
'Blue Eagle is airborne.
Ready to receive.

22
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.160
'We're on our way.'

23
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.510
Hello, Kate Stewart's phone?

24
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.790
Oh, hold on.

25
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.790
Excuse me...sorry!

26
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.070
Ma'am! Ma'am!

27
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.990
The ravens are looking
a bit sluggish.

28
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.230
Tell Malcolm they need new
batteries. It's him!

29
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.470
Sorry, it's your personal phone,
but, well,

30
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.070
I recognised the ringtone.
It's him, isn't it?

31
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.150
Inhaler.

32
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.270
Doctor, hello.
We found the TARDIS in a field.

33
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.240
'I'm having it brought in.'
No kidding!

34
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.160
'Where are you?'

35
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.230
Oh, my God!

36
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.640
'Oh, Doctor, I'm so sorry, we had
no idea you were still in there.'

37
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.830
Come on.

38
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.950
'Roger. New heading - 207.
Changing course.'

39
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.430
Argh...!

40
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.560
Doctor?! Clara!

41
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.190
Doctor, can you hear me?

42
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.990
Ow!

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.790
'I don't think he can hear me.'
Next time,

44
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.830
would it kill you to knock(?)

45
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.560
I'm having you taken
directly to the scene.

46
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.070
'Doctor, hello, are you OK?'

47
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.150
Whoa...!
I'm just going to pop you on hold.

48
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.120
'Doctor?' Ah! Doctor!

49
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.960
Atten...tion!

50
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.470
Why am I saluting?

51
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.270
Doctor,
as Chief Scientific Officer,

52
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.870
may I extend the
official apologies of UNIT...?

53
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.190
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,
a word to the wise.

54
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.510
As I'm sure your father
would've told you,

55
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.510
I don't like being picked up.

56
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.470
That probably sounded better
in his head.

57
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.070
I'm acting on instructions
direct from the throne.

58
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.880
Sealed orders from Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth the First.

59
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.150
The Queen? The First?
Sorry, Elizabeth the First?

60
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.670
Her credentials are inside.

61
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.440
No. Inside...

62
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.950
Nice scarf.

63
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.550
What's our cover story for this?

64
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.270
Um, Derren Brown. Again?

65
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.430
Oh, we've sent him flowers.

66
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590
Atten...tion!

67
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.920
Right, I want a secure
perimeter around the gallery.

68
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.870
Did you know her?
Elizabeth the First?

69
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.070
Unified Intelligence Task Force.
Sorry?

70
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.870
This lot. UNIT. They investigate
alien stuff, anything alien.

71
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.430
What, like you?
I work for them.

72
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.510
You have a job?!
Why shouldn't I have a job?

73
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.510
I'd be brilliant at having a job.

74
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.590
You don't have a job!

75
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.550
I do. This is my job,
I'm doing it now.

76
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.400
You never have a job.
I do! I do.

77
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.270
Elizabeth's credentials, Doctor.

78
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.030
But...

79
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.270
but that's not possible.

80
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.070
No more.

81
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.550
No more.

82
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.190
That's the title.
I know the title!

83
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.750
Also known as Gallifrey Falls.

84
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.550
This painting doesn't belong here -

85
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.270
not in this time or place.
Obviously.

86
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.390
It's the fall of Arcadia,

87
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.990
Gallifrey's second city.

88
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.760
But how is it doing that?
How is that possible?

89
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.800
It's an oil painting...

90
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.710
..in 3D.

91
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.550
Time Lord art.

92
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.640
Bigger on the inside.
A slice of real time...

93
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.760
..frozen.

94
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.360
Elizabeth told us where
to find it...and its significance.

95
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.790
You OK?

96
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.110
He was there.

97
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.240
Who was? Me.

98
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.710
The other me.

99
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.550
The one I don't talk about.

100
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.800
I don't understand.

101
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.990
I've had many faces, many lives.

102
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.550
I don't admit to all of them.

103
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.270
There's one life I've tried
very hard to forget.

104
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.310
No more.

105
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.230
He was the Doctor
who fought in the Time War,

106
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.910
and that was the day he did it -
the day I did it.

107
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.760
The day he killed them all.

108
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.750
The last day of the Time War.

109
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.270
The war to end all wars
between my people and the Daleks.

110
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.550
And in that battle, there was a man
with more blood on his hands

111
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.390
than any other.

112
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.110
A man who would commit a crime
that would silence the universe,

113
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.550
and that man...was me.

114
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.280
MUSIC: "First There Were Daleks"

115
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.950
Exterminate!

116
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.390
Argh!

117
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.320
Exterminate!

118
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.790
Message for the High Council,
Priority Omega.

119
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.720
Arcadia has fallen.
I repeat, Arcadia has fallen.

120
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.550
Soldier...

121
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.080
I'm going to need your gun.

122
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.870
Exterminate!

123
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.350
Exterminate!

124
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.880
Exterminate!

125
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.800
Please! Please, just don't!

126
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.750
Alert! Alert!

127
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.990
The Doctor is detected!

128
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.270
The Doctor is surrounded!

129
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.750
Inform High Command,
we have the Doctor!

130
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.790
Seek, locate, destroy!

131
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.480
The Doctor is surrounded...

132
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.390
Seek, locate, destroy! Seek...

133
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.830
The...Doctor...is...escaping.

134
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.350
What...are...these...words?

135
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.990
Explain!

136
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480
Explain!

137
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.430
The High Council
is in emergency session -

138
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.990
they have plans of their own.
To hell with the High Council -

139
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.470
their plans have already failed.

140
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.790
Gallifrey's still
in the line of fire.

141
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.880
So he was there, then?

142
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.270
He left a message,
a written warning for the Daleks.

143
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.390
He's a fool.

144
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.870
No. He's a madman.

145
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.950
As you can see, sir, all Dalek
fleets surrounding the planet,

146
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.790
now converging on the capital,
but the Sky Trenches are holding.

147
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.470
Where did he go next?

148
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.150
What does it matter? This is
their biggest ever attack, sir -

149
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.510
they're throwing everything at us...
Sir,

150
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.160
we have a security breach
to the Time Vaults.

151
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.190
The Omega Arsenal,

152
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.390
where all the
forbidden weapons are locked away.

153
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.790
They're not forbidden any more -

154
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.830
we've used them all
against the Daleks.

155
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.950
No.

156
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.760
No, we haven't.

157
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.710
The Moment is gone.

158
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.400
I don't understand. What is
the Moment? I've never heard of it.

159
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.440
The galaxy eater.

160
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.070
The final work of the ancients
of Gallifrey,

161
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.360
a weapon so powerful, the operating
system became sentient.

162
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.950
According to legend...

163
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.510
it developed a conscience.

164
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.190
And we've never used it?

165
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.150
How do you use a weapon
of ultimate mass destruction

166
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.000
when it can
stand in judgment on you?

167
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.760
There is only one man
who would even try.

168
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.560
Time Lords of Gallifrey,
Daleks of Skaro...

169
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.440
..I serve notice on you all.

170
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.120
Too long I have stayed my hand.
No more.

171
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.790
Today, you leave me no choice.

172
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.920
Today, this war will end.

173
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.600
No more.

174
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.600
No more.

175
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.560
How...

176
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.680
..how do you work?

177
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.200
Why is there never a big red button?

178
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.240
Hello?

179
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.070
Is somebody there?

180
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.630
It's nothing.

181
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.430
It's just a wolf.

182
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.830
Don't sit on that!
Why not?

183
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.350
Because it's not a chair -

184
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.600
it's the most dangerous weapon
in the universe.

185
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.760
Why can't it be both?

186
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.760
Why did you park so far away?

187
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.030
Didn't you want her to see it?

188
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.670
Want who to see?

189
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.150
The TAR...DIS.

190
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.270
You walked for miles.

191
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.830
And miles
and miles and miles and miles.

192
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.270
I was thinking!
I heard you.

193
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.800
You heard me?

194
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.400
"No...more."

195
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.670
"No more."

196
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.150
'No more.'

197
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.950
"No more."
No more.

198
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.110
"No more!" Stop it!
"No more!"

199
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.990
"No more."
Who are you?

200
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.590
It's activating. Get out of here!

201
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.430
Ow!
What's wrong?

202
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.190
The interface is hot.

203
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.120
Well, I do my best.

204
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.040
There's a power source inside...

205
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.430
You're the Interface?

206
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.320
They must have told you
the Moment had a conscience.

207
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.360
Hello!

208
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.710
Oh, look at you.

209
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.630
Stuck between a girl and a box.

210
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.670
Story of your life, eh, Doctor?

211
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.200
You know me?

212
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.870
I hear you.

213
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.830
All of you, jangling around
in that dusty old head of yours.

214
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.870
I chose this face and form
especially for you.

215
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.510
It's from your past.

216
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.230
Or possibly your future -
I always get those two mixed up.

217
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.590
I don't have a future.

218
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.230
I think I'm called...

219
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.390
Rose Tyler.

220
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.430
No, yes, no, sorry.

221
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.520
No, no, in this form,
I'm called...

222
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.760
..Bad Wolf.

223
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.390
Are you afraid
of the big bad wolf, Doctor?

224
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.310
Stop calling me Doctor.
That's the name in your head.

225
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.790
It shouldn't be.

226
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.150
I've been fighting this war
for a very long time -

227
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.270
I've lost the right
to be the Doctor.

228
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.430
Then you're the one to save us all.

229
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.230
Yes.

230
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.080
If I ever develop an ego,
you've got the job.

231
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.120
If you have been inside my head...

232
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.800
..then you know what I've seen.

233
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.120
The suffering.

234
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.550
Every moment
in time and space is burning.

235
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.430
It must end.

236
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.430
And I intend to end it
the only way I can.

237
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.750
And you're going to use me
to end it by killing them all,

238
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.430
Daleks and Time Lords alike.

239
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.990
I could, but there will be
consequences for you.

240
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I have no desire to survive this.

241
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.510
Then that's your punishment.

242
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.680
If you do this - if you kill them
all - then that's the consequence.

243
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.280
You...live.

244
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.350
Gallifrey...

245
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.270
you're going to burn it...

246
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.880
and all those Daleks with it
but all those children too.

247
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.720
How many children
on Gallifrey right now?

248
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.520
I don't know.

249
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.880
One day you will count them.

250
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.080
One terrible night.

251
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.520
Do you want to see
what that will turn you into?

252
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.560
Come on! Aren't you curious?

253
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.600
I'm opening windows on your future.

254
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.550
A tangle in time
through the days to come,

255
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.480
to the man today will make of you.

256
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.240
OK, I wasn't expecting that.

257
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.510
But the Time War's over.

258
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.670
Why have you brought us here
to look at a painting?

259
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.310
The painting only serves
as Elizabeth's credentials,

260
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.670
proof that the letter is from her.

261
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.160
It's not why you're here.

262
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.590
'My dearest love, I hope the
painting known as Gallifrey Falls

263
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.990
'will serve as proof that it is your
Elizabeth who writes to you now.

264
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.110
'You will recall
that you pledged yourself

265
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.910
'to the safety of my kingdom.

266
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.470
'In this capacity,
I have appointed you as curator

267
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.470
'of the Under Gallery where deadly
danger to England is locked away.

268
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.310
'Should any disturbance
occur within its walls,

269
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.040
'it is my wish that you be summoned.
God speed, gentle husband.'

270
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.310
What happened?

271
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.960
Easier to show you.

272
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.320
McGillop.

273
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.910
But that's not possible.
I was just...

274
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.960
Understood, sir.
But...why would I take it there?

275
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.960
Elizabeth the First?
You knew her, then?

276
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.320
A long time ago.

277
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.590
Allons-y!

278
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.750
There you go, Your Majesty,
what did I tell you?

279
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.510
Bigger on the inside!

280
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.950
The door isn't -
you nearly took my head off.

281
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.470
It's normally me who does that.

282
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.470
Tell me, Doctor, why I'm wasting
my time on you. I have wars to plan.

283
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.830
You have a picnic to eat.

284
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.870
You could help me.

285
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.350
Well...

286
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.040
I'm helping you eat the picnic.

287
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.920
But you have a stomach for war.

288
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.150
This face has seen conflict -

289
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.950
it's clear as day.

290
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.480
Oh, I've seen conflict
like you wouldn't believe.

291
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.360
But it wasn't this face.

292
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.470
But never mind that, Your Majesty -
up on your feet! Up, up!

293
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.510
How dare you?!

294
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.030
I'm the Queen of England!

295
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.630
I'm not English.

296
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.470
Elizabeth,

297
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.150
will you marry me?

298
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.070
Oh, my dear, sweet love.
Of course I will!

299
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.790
Ah! Gotcha!
My love?

300
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.190
One! The real Elizabeth would never
have accepted my marriage proposal.

301
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.350
Two! The real Elizabeth would notice

302
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.830
when I just casually mention
having a different face.

303
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.710
But then the real Elizabeth

304
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.430
isn't an alien shape-shifting
from outer space!

305
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.630
And...

306
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.230
DING!
..ding.

307
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.590
What's that?

308
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.590
It's a machine that goes...ding!

309
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.110
DING!
Made it myself.

310
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.910
It lights up in the presence
of shape-shifter DNA. Ooh.

311
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.990
Also it can microwave
frozen dinners from up to 20 feet

312
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.430
and download comics from the future.

313
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.830
I never know when to stop.
My love, I do not understand.

314
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.920
I'm not your love.
And yes, you do!

315
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.350
You're a Zygon.

316
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.630
A Zygon?

317
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.150
Oh, stop it, it's over!
A Zygon, yes.

318
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.310
A big red rubbery thing,
covered in suckers.

319
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.790
Surprisingly good kisser.

320
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.750
Think the real Queen of England
would just decide

321
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.310
to share the throne with any old
handsome bloke in a tight suit...

322
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.150
..just cos he's got amazing hair

323
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.400
and a nice horse?

324
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.350
Oh.

325
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.830
It was the horse!

326
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.390
I'm going to be King!

327
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.910
Run! What's happening?
We're being attacked

328
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.630
by a shape-shifting alien
from outer space,

329
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.750
formerly disguised as my horse.
What does that mean?

330
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.720
It means...
we're going to need a new horse.

331
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.910
Where's it going?

332
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.190
I'll hold it off, you run.
Your people need you.

333
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.640
And I need you
alive for our wedding day.

334
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.350
Oh, good work, Doctor, nice one!

335
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.520
The Virgin Queen?
So much for history!

336
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.670
Come on!

337
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.990
Know you're there!
DING!

338
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

339
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.590
Oh, very clever.

340
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.510
Whatever you've got planned,
forget it.

341
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.030
I'm the Doctor.

342
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.030
I'm 904 years old.

343
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.230
I'm from the planet Gallifrey in
the constellation of Kasterborous.

344
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.670
I am the oncoming storm,
the bringer of darkness,

345
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.000
and you are basically
just a rabbit, aren't you?

346
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.390
OK, carry on -
just a...general...

347
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.870
warning.

348
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.560
DING!
Doctor! >

349
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.350
Elizabeth!

350
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.110
That thing...explain what it is!

351
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.710
What does it want of us?

352
00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.310
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Probably just your planet.

353
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.750
Doctor? >

354
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.270
Step away from her, Doctor.
That's not me, that's the creature.

355
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.230
How is that possible? She's me.

356
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.910
Doctor, she's me!

357
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.830
I am, indeed, me. A compliment
that cannot be extended to yourself.

358
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.190
Extraordinary!

359
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.750
The creature has captured
my exact likeness -

360
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.550
this is exceptional.

361
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.270
Exceptional? A Queen
would call it impertinent.

362
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.310
A Queen would feel
compelled to admire

363
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.590
the skill of the execution -

364
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.430
before arranging one.

365
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.950
Ah! It's not working!

366
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.070
One might surmise
the creature would learn quickly

367
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.070
to protect itself
from any simple means of detection.

368
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.030
DING!
Clearly you understand
the creature better than I.

369
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.950
But then you have the advantage.

370
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.670
Back, both of you, now!

371
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.710
That's a time fissure,
a tear in the fabric of reality.

372
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.160
Anything could happen!

373
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.390
For instance...

374
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.160
a fez.

375
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.200
This way.

376
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.400
Welcome to the Under Gallery.

377
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.310
This is where Elizabeth the First
kept all art

378
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.600
deemed too dangerous
for public consumption.

379
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.270
Stone dust.

380
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.550
Is it important?

381
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.990
In 1,200 years, I've never stepped
in anything that wasn't.

382
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.910
Oi, you! Are you sciencey?

383
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.270
Oh, erm. Well, erm...yes.

384
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.190
Got a name? Yes.

385
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.350
Good, I've always wanted
to meet someone called Yes.

386
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.590
Now, I want this stone dust
analysed.

387
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.390
And I want a report in triplicate,

388
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.550
with lots of graphs and diagrams
and complicated sums,

389
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.350
on my desk, tomorrow morning, ASAP,
pronto, LOL.

390
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.750
See? Job.

391
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.710
Do I have a desk?
No. And I want a desk!

392
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.120
Get a team, analyse the stone dust.

393
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.360
Inhaler!

394
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.270
Someday,
you could just walk past a fez.

395
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.000
Never going to happen.

396
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.760
As you instructed,
nothing has been touched.

397
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.480
This is why we called you in.

398
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.030
3D again.

399
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.190
Interesting.
The broken glass?

400
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.390
No...

401
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.400
where it's broken from.

402
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.310
Look at the shatter pattern.

403
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.040
The glass on all these paintings
has been broken from the inside.

404
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.110
As you can see,
all the paintings are landscapes -

405
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.270
no figures of any kind. So?

406
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.600
There used to be.

407
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.990
Something's got out of the paintings?
Lots of somethings.

408
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.830
Dangerous.

409
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.670
This whole place has been searched.

410
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.600
There's nothing here that
shouldn't be, and nothing's got out.

411
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.230
Oh, no! Not now!

412
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.470
Doctor, what is it?
No, not now - I'm busy!

413
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.230
Is it to do with the paintings?

414
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.430
No, no. This is different.
I remember this.

415
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.280
Almost remember...

416
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.920
Oh, of course!

417
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.160
This is where I come in.

418
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.630
Geronimo-o...

419
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.670
Doctor! Wait.

420
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.000
..o-o-o!

421
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.190
Who is this man?

422
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.790
That's just what I was wondering.

423
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.670
Oh, that is skinny.

424
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.550
That is proper skinny.

425
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.470
I've never seen it from the outside.

426
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.520
It's like a special effect. Oi! Ha!
Matchstick man!

427
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.760
You're not...

428
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.190
Compensating? For what?
Regeneration - it's a lottery.

429
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.470
Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool?

430
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.710
"I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool -
oops, I'm wearing sandshoes!"

431
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.230
What are you doing here? I'm busy.

432
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.830
Oh, busy? I see, is that
what we're calling it, eh? Eh?

433
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.870
Hello, ladies. Don't start.
Listen, what you get up to

434
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.430
in the privacy of your own
regeneration is your business.

435
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.590
One of them is a Zygon.

436
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.630
Urgh...

437
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.870
I'm not judging you.

438
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.350
Oh, lovely!

439
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.550
Your Majesties...probably
a good time to run.

440
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.310
But what about the creature?
Elizabeth, whichever one of you

441
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.990
is the real one, turn and run in the
opposite direction to the other one.

442
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.150
Of course, my love!

443
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.190
Stay alive, my love.

444
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.760
I am not done with you yet.

445
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.590
Thanks. Lovely.

446
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.110
I understand.
Live for me, my darling.

447
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.360
We shall be together again.

448
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.840
Well, won't that be nice?

449
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.390
One of those was a Zygon. Yeah.

450
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.270
Big red rubbery thing.
Covered in suckers. Yeah.

451
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.950
Venom sacs in the tongue. Yeah,
I'm getting the point, thanks. Nice.

452
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.150
- Doctor? Is that you?
- Ah! Hello, Clara! Can you hear me?

453
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.590
Yeah, it's me, we can hear you.
Where are you?

454
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.390
Where are we?
England...1562.

455
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.710
Who are you talking to?

456
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.750
Myself.

457
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.310
Can you come back through?

458
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.710
Physical passage may not be possible
in both directions.

459
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.830
It's... Ah!

460
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.640
Hang on! Fez incoming!

461
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.360
Nothing here.

462
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.720
So where did it go?

463
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.120
- 'Who's he talking to?'
- 'He said - himself.'

464
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.710
Keep him talking. Malcolm? Malcolm,
I need you to send me

465
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.350
one of my father's incident files -
codenamed Cromer.

466
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.910
'70s or '80s,
depending on the dating protocol.

467
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.190
OK, you used to be me, you've done
all this before - what happens next?

468
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.150
I don't remember.

469
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.070
How can you forget this?!

470
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.110
Hey, hang on, it's not MY fault.

471
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.880
You're obviously not paying enough
attention. Reverse the polarity!

472
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.910
It's not working.
We're both reversing the polarity!

473
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.230
Yes, I know that. There's two
of us - I'm reversing it,

474
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.200
and you're reversing it back again!
We're confusing the polarity.

475
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.430
Anyone lose a fez?

476
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.190
You.

477
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.870
How can you be here?

478
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.030
More to the point, WHY are you here?

479
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.950
Good afternoon.

480
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.800
I'm...looking for the Doctor.

481
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.390
Well...you've certainly
come to the right place.

482
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.950
Good! Right!

483
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.750
Well, who are you boys?

484
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.430
Oh, of course!
Are you his companions?

485
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.030
His companions?

486
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.110
They get younger all the time!

487
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.520
Well, if you could point me in the
general direction of the Doctor...

488
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.550
Really?

489
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.830
Yeah.

490
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.870
Really.
You're me? Both of you?

491
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.230
Yep. Even that one?

492
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.030
Yes!

493
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.790
You're my future selves.

494
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.070
Yes! Yes!

495
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.550
Am I having a mid-life crisis?

496
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.670
Why are you pointing
your screwdrivers like that?

497
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.390
They're scientific instruments,
not water pistols.

498
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.120
Look like you've seen a ghost!

499
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.750
Still...loving the posh, gravelly
thing. It's very convincing.

500
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.470
Brave words, Dick Van Dyke.

501
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.910
Encircle them!

502
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.800
Which of you is the Doctor?

503
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.110
The Queen of England is bewitched.
I would have the Doctor's head.

504
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.720
Well, this has all
the makings of your lucky day.

505
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.670
I think there's three of them now.

506
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.630
'There's a precedent for that.'

507
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.160
What is that?

508
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.590
Oh, the pointing again.
They're screwdrivers!

509
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.990
What are you going to do,
assemble a cabinet at them(?)

510
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.670
That thing...what witchcraft
is it?

511
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.150
Ah, yes!

512
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.750
Now that you mention it,
that is witchcraft, yes, yes, yes.

513
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.390
Witchy-witchcraft. Hello?
Hello in there? Excuse me. Hello!

514
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.110
Am I talking to the wicked witch
of the well?

515
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.950
He means you.

516
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.790
Why am I the witch?

517
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.030
'Clara?' Hello?

518
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.430
Clara, hi, hello.

519
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.510
Hello. Would you mind telling
these prattling mortals

520
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.030
to get themselves begone?

521
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.830
What...he said.

522
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.070
Yes, tiny bit more colour.

523
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.470
Right.

524
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.030
Prattling mortals,
off you pop,

525
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.270
or I'll turn you all into frogs.

526
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.190
Oh, frogs, nice. You heard her.

527
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.150
Doctor, what's going on?

528
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.630
It's a...timey-wimey thing.

529
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.230
Timey...what? Timey-wimey?

530
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.750
I've no idea
where he picks that stuff up.

531
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.270
The Queen!

532
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.270
You don't seem to be kneeling.
How tremendously brave of you.

533
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.750
Which one are you? What happened
to the other one? Indisposed.

534
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.710
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!

535
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.070
Arrest these men.
Take them to the Tower.

536
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.670
That is not the Queen of England -
that's an alien duplicate!

537
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.430
And you can take it from him, cos
he's really checked. Oh, shut up!

538
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.430
Venom sacs in the tongue.
Seriously, stop it!

539
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.270
No, hang on, the Tower!
Did you say the Tower?

540
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.910
Ah, yes, brilliant, love the Tower.
Breakfast at eight, please.

541
00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.950
Will there Wi-Fi?

542
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.110
Are you capable of speaking
without flapping your hands about?

543
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.430
Yes! No!

544
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.830
I demand to be incarcerated
in the Tower immediately

545
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.510
with my co-conspirators,
Sandshoes and Grandad! Grandad?

546
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.870
They're not sandshoes.
Yes, they are!

547
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.430
Silence! The tower is not
to be taken lightly.

548
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.190
'Very few emerge again.'

549
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.070
Dear God, that man's clever.
Come on! Where are we going?

550
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.040
My office. Otherwise known
as the Tower of London.

551
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.440
Oi, you lot, get in there!

552
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.200
Ow!

553
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.310
TING!

554
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.510
Three of us in one cell -

555
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.390
that's going to cause some nasty
anomalies if we don't get out soon.

556
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.680
What are you doing?

557
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.430
Getting us out! The sonic won't
work on that - it's too primitive.

558
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.990
Shall we ask for a better quality
of door so we can escape(?)

559
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.910
OK, so the Queen of England
is now a Zygon,

560
00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.790
but never mind that,
why are we all together?

561
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.480
Why are we all here?

562
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.710
Well, me and...Chinny,
we were surprised.

563
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.310
But you came looking for us -

564
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.150
you knew it was going to happen.
Who told you?

565
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.510
Oi! "Chinny"?

566
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.440
Yeah, you do have a chin.

567
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.070
Marble, granite...
a lot of different stone,

568
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.190
but none of it from the fabric
of the building.

569
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.190
It's like somebody smashed up
a lot of old statues.

570
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.590
Are there any missing?

571
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.110
Don't think so.

572
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.040
Why would anyone do that anyway?

573
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.870
I mean, I know we're meant
to keep an open mind,

574
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.230
but are we supposed
to believe in creatures

575
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.950
that can hide in oil paintings

576
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.920
and have some sort
of a grudge against statues?

577
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.400
You all right?

578
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.470
We have to go - right now,
this minute. What's wrong?

579
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.790
The things from the paintings...

580
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.960
I know
why they smashed the statues.

581
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.800
Why? Because they needed
somewhere to hide.

582
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.160
Oh!

583
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.790
The Doctor will save me,
the Doctor will save me,

584
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.430
the Doctor will save me,
the Doctor will save me,

585
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.390
the Doctor will save me,
the Doctor will save me...

586
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.880
Excuse me -
I'm going to need my inhaler.

587
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.990
I so hate it
when I get one with a defect!

588
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.470
Oh, you've got some perfectly
horrible memories in here,

589
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.560
haven't you?

590
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.550
So jealous
of your pretty sister.

591
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.680
I don't blame you,
I wish I'd copied HER.

592
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.720
So do I!

593
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.840
Oh, for goodness' sake...!

594
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.350
The Doctor will be trying
to send us a message.

595
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.070
We're looking for
a string of numerals

596
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.230
from around 1550, approximately -
priority one.

597
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.080
I'm going to need access
to the Black Archive.

598
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.310
The Black Archive.

599
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.670
Highest security
rating on the planet.

600
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.870
The entire staff have their memories
wiped at the end of every shift.

601
00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.710
Automated memory filters
in the ceiling.

602
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.040
Access, please. Ma'am.

603
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.470
Atkins, isn't it?

604
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.470
Yes, ma'am. First day here.

605
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.120
(Been here ten years.)

606
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.350
Lock and key - bit basic, isn't it?

607
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.430
Can't afford electronic
security down here -

608
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.750
got to keep the Doctor out.

609
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.350
The whole of the Tower
is TARDIS-proofed.

610
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.310
He really wouldn't approve of
the collection. But you let me in?

611
00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.350
You have a top-level security rating
from your last visit.

612
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.270
Sorry, my what?

613
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.030
Apologies. We have to screen
all of his known associates -

614
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.830
we can't have information
about the Doctor and the TARDIS

615
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.510
falling into the wrong hands.

616
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.280
The consequences
could be disastrous.

617
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.200
What is that?

618
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.630
Time travel.

619
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.670
A vortex manipulator,
bequeathed to the UNIT archive

620
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.390
by Captain Jack Harkness,
on the occasion of his death.

621
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.150
Well, one of them.

622
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.790
No-one can know we have this,
not even our allies. Why not?

623
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.390
Think about it! Americans
with the ability to rewrite history?

624
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.080
You've seen their movies.

625
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.510
OK, so this is how
we're going to rescue the Doctor.

626
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.830
I'm not sure there's enough power
for a two-way trip.

627
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.230
In any event,
we don't know the activation code.

628
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.590
The Doctor knows we have this,

629
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.390
so he's always kept
the code from us.

630
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.990
Let's hope he changes his mind.

631
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.950
Yes.

632
00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.670
Well, if you've found it,

633
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.920
photograph it
and send it to my phone.

634
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.270
Erm, Kate. Should they be here?

635
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.750
Why have they followed us?

636
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.870
Oh, they've probably just finished
disposing of the humans a bit early.

637
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.030
The humans...?

638
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.840
Dear me! I really do
get into character, don't I?

639
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.150
The Under Gallery is secured.

640
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.920
Prepare to dispose of one more
human. We have acquired the device.

641
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.640
Activation code - right?

642
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.670
In theory, I can trigger
an isolated sonic shift

643
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.990
among the molecules,
and the door should disintegrate.

644
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.270
We'd have to calculate
the exact harmonic resonance

645
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.470
of the entire structure
down to a sub-atomic level.

646
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.830
Even the sonic would take years.

647
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.150
No, no. The sonic
would take centuries.

648
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.150
Oh, we might as well get started.

649
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.240
Help to pass the "timey-wimey".

650
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.350
Do you have to talk like children?

651
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.320
What is it that makes you
so ashamed of being a grown-up?

652
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.510
Oh, the way you both look at me.
What is that?

653
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.080
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "dread".

654
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.470
It must be really recent for you.

655
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.480
Recent?

656
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.710
The Time War, the last day.
The day you killed them all.

657
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.440
The day WE killed them all.
Same thing.

658
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.830
It's history for them. All decided.

659
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.070
They think their future is real -
they don't know

660
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.070
it's still up to you.

661
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.590
I don't talk about it.

662
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.670
You're not talking about it. There's
no-one else here. Go on. Ask them.

663
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.720
Ask them what you need to know.

664
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.710
Did you ever count?

665
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.040
Count what?

666
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.920
How many children there were
on Gallifrey that day.

667
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.510
I have absolutely no idea.

668
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.630
How old are you now?

669
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.430
Ah...I don't know, I lose track.

670
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.910
Twelve hundred and something,
I think, unless I'm lying.

671
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.670
I can't remember if I'm lying
about my age - that's how old I am.

672
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.430
400 years older than me.

673
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.950
And in all that time, you've never
even wondered how many there were?

674
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.360
You never once counted?

675
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.350
Tell me...

676
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.670
what would be the point?

677
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.430
2.47 billion.

678
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.800
You DID count!

679
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.710
You forgot?

680
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.830
400 years? Is that all it takes?

681
00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.750
I moved on.

682
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.150
Where?! Where can you be now that
you can forget something like that?

683
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.830
Spoilers. No.

684
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.390
No, no, no. For once, I would
like to know where I'm going.

685
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.760
No. You really wouldn't.

686
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.590
I don't know who you are...
either of you.

687
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.670
I haven't got the faintest idea.

688
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.120
They're you.

689
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.640
They're what you become
if you destroy Gallifrey.

690
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.120
The man who regrets...

691
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.310
..and the man who forgets.

692
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.750
The moment is coming.

693
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.760
The Moment is me,
you have to decide.

694
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.590
No.

695
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.880
No?

696
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.310
Just...no!

697
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.710
Is something funny?
Did I miss a funny thing?

698
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.790
Sorry. It just occurred to me.

699
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.800
This is what I'm like
when I'm alone.

700
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.200
It's the same screwdriver.

701
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.400
Same software...different case.

702
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.950
400 years!

703
00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.150
I'm sorry?

704
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.390
At a software level, they're all
the same device, aren't they?

705
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.830
Same software, different case.

706
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.910
Yeah. So...?

707
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.750
So, it would take centuries
for the screwdriver to calculate

708
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.510
how to disintegrate the door.
Scanning the door,

709
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.870
implanting the calculation
as a permanent subroutine

710
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.230
in the software architecture

711
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.510
and...if you really are me,

712
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.070
with your sandshoes
and your dicky bow,

713
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.680
and that screwdriver
is still mine...

714
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.960
..that calculation
is still going on.

715
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.550
Yeah. Still going.

716
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.750
Calculation complete.

717
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.510
Same software. Different face.

718
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.030
Eh, 400 years in four seconds.
We may have our differences,

719
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.870
which is frankly odd
in the circumstances,

720
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.160
but I tell you what, boys,
we are incredibly clever!

721
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.790
How did you that?

722
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.470
It wasn't locked. Right.

723
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.910
So they're both you, then, yeah?

724
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.470
Yes. You've met them before,
don't you remember?

725
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.590
A bit. Nice suit!

726
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.910
Thanks.

727
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.430
Hang on.

728
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.430
Three of you in one cell, and none
of you thought to try the door.

729
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.670
It should have been locked.

730
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.510
Yes, exactly! Why wasn't it locked?

731
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.990
Because I was fascinated to see
what you would do upon escaping.

732
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.550
I understand
you're rather fond of this world.

733
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.840
It's time I think you saw
what's going to happen to it.

734
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.880
Ah!

735
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.070
Kate? Oh, goodness,
you're not actually dead.

736
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.880
Oh, that's tremendous news!

737
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.630
Those creatures,
they turn themselves into copies.

738
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.510
And they need to keep the original
alive, refresh the image,

739
00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.710
so to speak.

740
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.470
Where...where did they go?

741
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.270
I don't know. Ooh, hang on -
yes, I do. The Tower.

742
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.590
If those creatures have got access
to the Black Archive,

743
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.880
we may just have lost control
of the planet.

744
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.990
The Zygons lost their own world.

745
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.470
It burned in the first days
of the Time War.

746
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.800
A new home is required.

747
00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.870
So they want this one?

748
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.470
Not yet. Far too primitive.

749
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.310
Zygons are used to a certain level
of comfort.

750
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.480
Commander...

751
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.950
..why are these creatures here?

752
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.590
Because I say they should be.

753
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.240
It is time you too were translated.

754
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.350
Observe this.

755
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.350
I believe
you will find it fascinating.

756
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.630
That's him! That's the Zygon
in the picture now.

757
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.950
It's not a picture,
it's a Stasis Cube.

758
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.750
Time Lord art -

759
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.470
frozen instants in time,
bigger on the inside

760
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.830
but could be deployed as...

761
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.390
..Suspended animation.
Oh, that's very good.

762
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.390
The Zygons all pop inside the
pictures, wait a few centuries

763
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.230
till the planet's a bit more
interesting, and then out they come.

764
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.350
You see, Clara,

765
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.630
they're stored in the paintings in
the Under Gallery, like Cup-a-Soups.

766
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.990
Except you add time -
if you can picture that.

767
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.910
Nobody could picture that.
Forget I said Cup-a-Soups.

768
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.070
And now the world
is worth conquering.

769
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.150
So the Zygons are invading
the future

770
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.470
from the past.

771
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.240
Exactly!

772
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.150
And do you know
why I know that you're a fake?

773
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.750
Because you're such a bad copy.

774
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.470
It's not just the smell,
or the unconvincing hair,

775
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.110
or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes
just a bit too close together,

776
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.670
or the breath
that could stun a horse -

777
00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.270
it's because my Elizabeth,
the real Elizabeth,

778
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.430
would never be stupid enough
to reveal her own plan.

779
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.630
Honestly, why would you do that?

780
00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.150
Because it's not my plan,

781
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.320
and I AM the real Elizabeth.

782
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.870
OK. So...backtracking a moment,

783
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.550
just to lend some context
to my earlier remarks...

784
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.510
My twin is dead in the forest.

785
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.910
I am accustomed
to taking precautions.

786
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.550
These Zygon creatures never even
considered that it was me

787
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.990
who survived,
rather than their own commander.

788
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.550
The arrogance
that typifies their kind.

789
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.670
Zygons?

790
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.310
Men!
And you actually killed one of them?

791
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.710
I may have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

792
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.510
but at the time, so did the Zygon.

793
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.910
The future of my kingdom
is imperilled.

794
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.110
Doctor, can I rely on your service?

795
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.550
Well, I'm going to need my TARDIS.

796
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.990
It has been procured already. Ah!

797
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.920
But first, my love,
you have a promise to keep!

798
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.830
I now pronounce you...man and wife.

799
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.160
You may kiss the bride.

800
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.510
Is there a lot of this
in the future?

801
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.800
It does start to happen, yeah.

802
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.670
God speed, my love.

803
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.600
I will be right back.

804
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.640
Whoo!

805
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.480
Right, then,
back to the future.

806
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.350
You've let this place go a bit!

807
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.630
Ah, it's his grunge phase.
He grows out of it.

808
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.350
Don't you listen to them!

809
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.950
Ooh! The desktop is glitching.

810
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.150
Three of us from different time
zones, it's trying to compensate.

811
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.870
Hey, look, the round things.

812
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.070
I love the round things.
What ARE the round things?

813
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.950
No idea.

814
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.470
Oh, dear,
the friction contrafibulator.

815
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.520
Ha! There! Stabilised.

816
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.190
Oh, you've redecorated!

817
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.230
I don't like it.

818
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.590
Oh? Oh, yeah. Oh,

819
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.310
you never do! Listen, we're
going to the National Gallery -
the Zygons are underneath it.

820
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.200
No, UNIT HQ, they followed us there
in the Black Archive.

821
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.760
OK...so you've heard of that, then.

822
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.150
The equipment here is phenomenal.

823
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.910
The humans don't realise
what half this stuff does -

824
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.790
we could conquer
their world in a day.

825
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.190
We were fortunate, then...

826
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.470
in our choice of duplicate.

827
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.430
If I were human,
I'd say it was Christmas.

828
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.550
No. I'm afraid you wouldn't.
We're not armed. You may relax.

829
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.070
We are armed. You may not.

830
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.870
Lock the door.

831
00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.800
I'm afraid we can't be interrupted.

832
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.350
You don't mind if I get comfortable?

833
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.360
You don't mind if I do?

834
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.510
You'll realise there are protocols
protecting this place.

835
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.510
Osgood... In the event
of alien incursion,

836
00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.670
the contents of this room are deemed
so dangerous,

837
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.030
it will self-destruct in...
Five minutes.

838
00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.190
There's a nuclear warhead
20 feet beneath us.

839
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.670
Are you sitting comfortably?

840
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.630
You would destroy London?

841
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.430
To save the world? Yes, I would.

842
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.670
You're bluffing.

843
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.950
You really think so?

844
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.750
Somewhere in your memory
is a man called

845
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.990
Brigadier Alistair Gordon
Lethbridge-Stewart.

846
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.190
I'm his daughter.

847
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.950
' "Science leads," Kate.
Is that what you meant?

848
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.510
'Is this what your father meant?'

849
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.990
Doctor?
'Space-Time Telegraph, Kate.

850
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.910
'A gift from me to your father,
hotline straight to the TARDIS.'

851
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.830
I know about the Black Archive and
I know about the security protocol.

852
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.150
Kate, please,

853
00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.710
please, tell me you are not about
to do something unbelievably stupid!

854
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.550
'I'm sorry, Doctor. Switch it off.'

855
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.590
'Not as sorry as you will be.'

856
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.440
This is not a decision
you will ever be able to live with.

857
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.270
Kate! We're trying to bring
the TARDIS in - why can't we land?

858
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.430
I said switch it off!

859
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.720
No, Kate, please,
just listen to me...

860
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.310
The Tower of London -
totally TARDIS-proof.

861
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.590
How can they do that?

862
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.750
Alien technology
plus human stupidity -

863
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.110
trust me, it's unbeatable.

864
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.600
We don't need to land.

865
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.070
Yeah, we do, a tiny bit.
Try and keep up.

866
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.840
No, we don't. We don't.
There is another way.

867
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.680
Cup-a-Soup!

868
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.920
What is Cup-a-Soup?

869
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.070
What happened?

870
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.680
Easier to show you.

871
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.150
McGillop.

872
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.680
Take a look at your phone
and confirm who you're talking to.

873
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.030
But that's not possible.
I was just...

874
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.950
'You were just talking to me,
I know.'

875
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.550
I'm a time traveller -
figure it out.

876
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.470
I need you to send the Gallifrey
Falls painting to the Black Archive.

877
00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.310
'Understood?'
Understood, sir.

878
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.390
But why would I take it there?

879
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.230
One word from you
would cancel the countdown.

880
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.270
Quite so.

881
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.790
It's keyed
to your voice print.

882
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.830
And mine alone.

883
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.230
Not any more. Cancel the detonation!

884
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.150
Countermanded!
Cancel the detonation!

885
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.390
Countermanded!

886
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.790
We only have to agree,
to live.

887
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.910
Sadly, we can only
agree to die.

888
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.990
Please, Doctor. Please save us.

889
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.230
Please save us. Please save us.

890
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.160
Please save us...

891
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.040
Exterminate!

892
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.510
Hello.

893
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.590
I'm the Doctor.

894
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.960
Sorry about the Dalek.

895
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.150
Also the showing off.

896
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.990
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, what
in the name of sanity are you doing?

897
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.510
The countdown can only be halted
at my personal command.

898
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.190
There's nothing you can do.

899
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.670
Except make you
both agree to halt it.

900
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.990
Not even for three of you.

901
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.190
You're about
to murder millions of people.

902
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.310
To save billions. How many times
have you made that calculation?

903
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.790
Once.

904
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.280
Turned me into the man I am now.

905
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.470
I'm not even sure
who that is any more.

906
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.070
You tell yourself
it's justified, but it's a lie.

907
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.670
Because what I did that day
was wrong. Just wrong.

908
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.070
And because I got it wrong...

909
00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.360
I'm going to make you...
get it right.

910
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.390
How?

911
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.030
Any second now, you're going
to stop that countdown.

912
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.190
Both of you. Together.

913
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.790
Then you're going to negotiate
the most perfect treaty of all time.

914
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.670
Safeguards all round,
fair on both sides.

915
00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.310
And the key
to perfect negotiation...

916
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.750
Not knowing what side you're on.

917
00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.110
So, for the next few hours...

918
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.590
until we decide to let you out...

919
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.270
No-one in this room will be able
to remember if they're human...

920
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.310
..Or Zygon.

921
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.080
Whoops-a-daisy!

922
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.160
Cancel the detonation!

923
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.280
Peace in our time.

924
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.790
It's funny, isn't it?

925
00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.350
If I'm a Zygon, then
my clothes must be Zygon too.

926
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.110
So, what happens
if I lose a shoe or something?

927
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.560
Oh!

928
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.230
Hello.

929
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.910
Hello. I'm Clara.

930
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.710
We haven't really met yet.

931
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.880
I look forward to it.

932
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.710
Is there a problem?

933
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.190
The Doctor - my...

934
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.590
my Doctor -

935
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.670
he's always talking
about the day he did it,

936
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.910
the day he wiped out
the Time Lords to stop the war...

937
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.670
One would.

938
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.040
You wouldn't.

939
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.040
Because you haven't done it yet.
It's still in your future.

940
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.150
You're very sure of yourself.

941
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.190
He regrets it.
I see it in his eyes every day.

942
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.710
He'd do anything to change it.

943
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.600
Including saving all these people.

944
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.790
How many worlds
has his regret saved, do you think?

945
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:56.640
Look over there - humans and Zygons
working together in peace.

946
00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.840
How did you know?

947
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.160
Your eyes.

948
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.400
You're so much younger.

949
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.800
Then, all things considered...

950
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.680
..it's time I grew up.

951
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.760
I've seen all I needed.

952
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.640
The moment has come.

953
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.710
I'm ready.

954
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.160
I know you are.>

955
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.120
Who's there?
Who were you talking to...?

956
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.070
You wanted a big red button.

957
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.230
One big bang - no more Time Lords,

958
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.430
no more Daleks.

959
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.840
Are you sure?

960
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.320
I was sure when I came in here.

961
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.470
There is no other way.

962
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.550
You've seen the men you will become.

963
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.430
Those men...

964
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.000
extraordinary.

965
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.790
They were you.

966
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.160
No.

967
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.710
They were the Doctor.

968
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.950
You're the Doctor too.

969
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.400
No.

970
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.400
Great men are forged in fire.

971
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.080
It is the privilege of lesser men
to light the flame...

972
00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.110
..whatever the cost.

973
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.710
You know the sound
the TARDIS makes?

974
00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.760
That wheezing...groaning.

975
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.840
That sound brings hope
wherever it goes.

976
00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.350
Yes. Yes, I like to think it does.

977
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.440
To anyone who hears it, Doctor.

978
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.320
Anyone, however lost...

979
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.040
..even you!

980
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.800
I told you - he hasn't done it yet.

981
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.030
Go away now, all of you.

982
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.400
This is for me.

983
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.710
These events should be time locked -
we shouldn't even be here.

984
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.350
So something let us through.

985
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.910
You clever boys!

986
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.070
Go back.

987
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.560
Go back to your lives.

988
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.870
Go and be the Doctor
that I could never be.

989
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.720
Make it worthwhile.

990
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.760
All those years,
burying you in my memory.

991
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.830
Pretending you didn't exist.

992
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.440
Keeping you a secret,
even from myself.

993
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.350
Pretending you weren't the Doctor,

994
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.750
when you were the Doctor
more than anybody else.

995
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:25.280
You were the Doctor on the day
it wasn't possible to get it right.

996
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.080
But this time...

997
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.440
..You don't have to do it alone.

998
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.720
Thank you.

999
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:48.280
What we do today
is not out of fear or hatred.

1000
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.240
It is done
because there is no other way.

1001
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.360
And it is done in the name of the
many lives we are failing to save.

1002
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.240
What?

1003
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.750
What is it, what?

1004
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.960
Nothing... No.

1005
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.830
It's something. Tell me!

1006
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.440
You told me you wiped out
your own people. I just...

1007
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.150
I never pictured you doing it,
that's all.

1008
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.600
Take a closer look.

1009
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.150
What's happening?

1010
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.760
Nothing - it's a projection.

1011
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.520
It's a reality around you.

1012
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.280
These are the people
you're going to burn?

1013
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.990
There isn't anything we can do.

1014
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.230
He's right.

1015
01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.230
There isn't another way,
there never was.

1016
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.470
Either I destroy my own people
or let the universe burn.

1017
01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.040
Look at you...

1018
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.390
..the three of you.

1019
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.430
The warrior. The hero.

1020
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.840
And you.

1021
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.190
And what am I?

1022
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.710
Have you really forgotten?

1023
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.630
Yes. Maybe, yes.

1024
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.830
We've got enough warriors -

1025
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.480
any old idiot can be hero.

1026
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.600
Then what do I do?

1027
01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.720
What you've always done.

1028
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.240
Be a doctor!

1029
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.790
You told me
the name you chose was a promise.

1030
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.040
What was the promise?

1031
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.000
Never cruel or cowardly.

1032
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.310
Never give up,

1033
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.960
never give in.

1034
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.190
You're not actually suggesting that
we change our own personal history?

1035
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.350
We change history all the time.

1036
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.550
I'm suggesting something far worse.

1037
01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.120
What, exactly?

1038
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.720
Gentleman, I have had 400 years
to think about this.

1039
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.360
I've changed my mind.

1040
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.070
There's still a billion
billion Daleks up there, attacking.

1041
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.790
Yeah, there is, there is.

1042
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.150
But there's something those billion
billion Daleks don't know.

1043
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.710
Cos if they did, they'd probably
send for reinforcements.

1044
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.270
What, what don't they know?

1045
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.990
This time, there's three of us.

1046
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.710
Oh!

1047
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.510
Oh! Oh, yes, that is good!

1048
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.150
That is brilliant!

1049
01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.110
Oh, oh, oh! I'm getting that too -
that is brilliant!

1050
01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.310
Ha-ha-ha! I've been thinking
about it for centuries!

1051
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.750
She didn't just show me
any old future -

1052
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.190
she showed me exactly the future
I needed to see!

1053
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.510
Now you're getting it.
Eh? Who did?

1054
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.830
Oh, Bad Wolf Girl, I could kiss you.

1055
01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.550
Yep, that's going to happen(!)
Sorry, did you say, "Bad Wolf"?

1056
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.990
So what are we doing?
What's the plan?

1057
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.310
The Dalek fleets are surrounding
Gallifrey, firing on it constantly.

1058
01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.190
The Sky Trench is holding,
but what if the whole planet...

1059
01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.670
just disappeared?
Tiny bit of an ask.

1060
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.190
The Daleks would be firing
on each other -

1061
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.070
they'd destroy themselves
in their own crossfire.

1062
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.470
Gallifrey would be gone,
the Daleks would be destroyed,

1063
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.510
and it would look
to the rest of the universe

1064
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.470
as if they'd annihilated
each other.

1065
01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.680
But where would Gallifrey be?
Frozen!

1066
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.990
Frozen in an instant of time,

1067
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.070
safe and hidden away.

1068
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.150
Exactly!

1069
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.960
Like a painting.

1070
01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.550
Another one!

1071
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.710
Are you sure the
message is from him?

1072
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.400
Oh, yes!
Why would he do that?

1073
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.190
What's the mad fool
talking about now?

1074
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.990
'Hello, hello,
Gallifrey High Command,

1075
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.430
'this is the Doctor speaking.'

1076
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.470
'Hello! Also the Doctor.
Can you hear me?'

1077
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.590
'Also the Doctor - standing ready.'

1078
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.270
Dear God, three of them!
All my worse nightmares at once!

1079
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.950
'General, we have a plan.'
We should point out, at this moment,

1080
01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.830
it is a fairly terrible plan.
'And almost certainly won't work.'

1081
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.710
'I was happy with
"fairly terrible".'

1082
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.350
'Sorry, just thinking out loud.'

1083
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.040
We're flying our three
TARDISes into your lower atmosphere.

1084
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.870
We're positioned at equidistant
intervals round the globe.

1085
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.360
"Equidistant" - so grown-up!

1086
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.830
We're just about ready to do it.

1087
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.710
'Ready to do what?'

1088
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.710
We're going to freeze Gallifrey.

1089
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.630
I'm sorry, what?

1090
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.150
Using our TARDISes,

1091
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.790
we're going to freeze Gallifrey
in a single moment in time.

1092
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.070
'You know, like those Stasis Cubes?'

1093
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.030
A single moment in time held
in a parallel pocket universe.

1094
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.030
Except we're going to do it
to a whole planet.

1095
01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.270
And all the people on it.

1096
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.710
What? Even if that were possible,

1097
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.790
'which it isn't,
why would you do such a thing?'

1098
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.030
Because the alternative is burning.
And I've seen that.

1099
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.360
And I never want to see it again.

1100
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.000
We'd be lost in another universe...

1101
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.110
..frozen in a single moment.

1102
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.750
We'd have nothing.

1103
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.390
You would have hope.

1104
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.110
And right now,
that is exactly what you don't have.

1105
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.950
It's delusional.
The calculations alone

1106
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.190
would take...hundreds of years.

1107
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.470
Oh, hundreds and hundreds.

1108
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.750
But don't worry -

1109
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.040
I started a very
long time ago!

1110
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.630
'Calling the War Council
of Gallifrey, this is the Doctor.'

1111
01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.270
You might say,
I've been doing this all my lives!

1112
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.870
'Good luck!' 'Stand by.'
'Ready?' 'Commencing calculations.'

1113
01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.110
'Soon be there.'

1114
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.710
'Across the boundaries that divide
one universe from another.

1115
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.030
'Just got to lock on
to his coordinates.'

1116
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.550
And for my next trick...!

1117
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.150
I didn't know when I was well off!
All 12 of them!

1118
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.360
No, sir...

1119
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.640
..all 13!

1120
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.870
Sir! The Daleks know
that something is happening.

1121
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.080
They're increasing their fire power.

1122
01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.990
Do it, Doctor.

1123
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.590
Just do it.

1124
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.080
'Do it!'

1125
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.430
OK.

1126
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.880
'Gentleman...we're ready.'

1127
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.270
Geronimo...!

1128
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.310
Allons-y!

1129
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.750
Oh, for God's sake!

1130
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.920
Gallifrey stands!

1131
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.680
I don't suppose we'll ever know
if we actually succeeded.

1132
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.510
But at worst,

1133
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.790
we failed doing the right thing,

1134
01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.040
as opposed to succeeding
in doing the wrong.

1135
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.840
Life and soul, you are(!)

1136
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.400
What is it actually called?

1137
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.430
Well, there's some debate.

1138
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.030
Either No More

1139
01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.110
or Gallifrey Falls.

1140
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.950
Not very encouraging.

1141
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.280
How did it get here?

1142
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.590
No idea.

1143
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.550
There's always something
we don't know, isn't there?

1144
01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.750
One should certainly hope so.

1145
01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.630
Well, gentlemen...

1146
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.070
it has been an honour...

1147
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.590
and a privilege.

1148
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.960
Likewise. Doctor.

1149
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.950
And if I grow to be half the man

1150
01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.150
that you are, Clara Oswald,

1151
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.110
I shall be happy indeed.

1152
01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.520
That's right - aim high!

1153
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.430
I won't remember this, will I?

1154
01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.030
The time streams are out of sync.

1155
01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.310
You can't retain it, no.

1156
01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.190
So I won't remember
that I tried to save Gallifrey,

1157
01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.920
rather than burn it.

1158
01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.240
I'll have to live with that.

1159
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.190
But for now,

1160
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.320
for this moment...

1161
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.560
..I am the Doctor again.

1162
01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.800
Thank you.

1163
01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.800
Which one is mine?!

1164
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.560
Ha!

1165
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.990
Oh, yes...

1166
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.760
Course,
suppose it makes sense...

1167
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.280
Wearing a bit thin.

1168
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.880
I hope the ears are bit
less conspicuous this time.

1169
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.360
I won't remember either,
so you might as well tell me.

1170
01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.270
Tell you what?

1171
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.040
Where it is we're going
that you don't want to talk about.

1172
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.430
I saw Trenzalore...

1173
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.880
where we're buried.

1174
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.320
We die in battle among millions.

1175
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.670
That's not how it's supposed to be.

1176
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.320
That's how the story ends -
nothing we can do about it.

1177
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.040
Trenzalore is where you're going.

1178
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.920
Oh, never say nothing.

1179
01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.790
Anyway...

1180
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.520
good to know my future
is in safe hands.

1181
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.350
Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.

1182
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.240
Mm! On it!

1183
01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.670
Trenzalore.

1184
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.360
We need a new destination,
because...

1185
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.320
..I don't want to go.

1186
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.800
He always says that.

1187
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.400
Need a moment alone
with your painting?

1188
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.280
How did you know?
Those big, sad eyes. Ah.

1189
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.800
I always know.

1190
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.750
Oh, by the way,
there was an old man looking for you.

1191
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.280
I think it was the curator.

1192
01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.590
I could be a curator.

1193
01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.750
I'd be great at curating.

1194
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.480
I'd be...the great curator.

1195
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.280
I could retire and do that.

1196
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.880
I could retire
and be the curator of this place.

1197
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.030
I never forget a face.

1198
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.750
I know you don't,
and in years to come,

1199
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.590
you might find yourself
revisiting a few

1200
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.120
but just...the old favourites, eh?

1201
01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.430
You were curious
about this painting, I think.

1202
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.590
I acquired it
in remarkable circumstances.

1203
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.430
What do you make of the title?

1204
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.440
Which title? There's two.

1205
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.240
No More...

1206
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.510
..or Gallifrey Falls?

1207
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.030
Oh, you see,
that's where everybody's wrong.

1208
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.240
It's all one title.

1209
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.870
Gallifrey Falls No More.

1210
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.760
Now, what would you think
that means, eh?

1211
01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.440
That Gallifrey didn't fall.

1212
01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.270
It worked. It's still out there.

1213
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.710
I'm only a humble curator -
I'm sure I wouldn't know.

1214
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.710
Then where is it?
Where is it indeed?

1215
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.630
Lost - shh! - perhaps.

1216
01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.390
Things do get lost, you know.

1217
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.310
Now you must excuse me.

1218
01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.670
Oh...

1219
01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.830
you have a lot to do.

1220
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.390
Do I? Mm.
Is that what I'm supposed to do now?

1221
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.750
Go looking for Gallifrey? Oh, it's
entirely up to you. Your choice.

1222
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.550
I can only tell you
what I would do,

1223
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.110
if I were you...

1224
01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.630
Oh...! If I were you...

1225
01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.710
Perhaps I WAS you, of course.

1226
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.190
Or perhaps...

1227
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.030
you are me.

1228
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.870
Yeah!
Congratulations.

1229
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.070
Thank you very much.

1230
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.510
Or perhaps it doesn't matter
either way.

1231
01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.790
Who knows?

1232
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.520
Who...knows?

'Clara sometimes asks me if I dream.

1234
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.550
' "Course I dream," I tell her.

1235
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.870

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.750

she'll ask.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.350
' "The same thing everybody
dreams about," I tell her.

1238
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.910

1239

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.150

you're just wandering about."

the same as anyone's.

so many lifetimes,

1245

where I'm going,
